of THE GAZETTE fever mosquito ami other disagreeables finding no field for their operations in this pure atmosphere The people were formerly rich in cattle until the plague which decimated their herds made its appearance a short time ago Even now they have plenty of sheep and goats whoso flesh is excellent eating owing to the rich pasturage on which they browse The station itself is well supplied with cattle sheep and goats as well as donkeys which have been purchased from the Masai The cattle enclosure is outside the fort and is strongly constructed of stout pointed palisades and the interior is arranged with a view of securing the health and comfort of its inmates On the lower part of the southern aspect of the hill on which the fort is built a well stocked garden of English vegetables lias been laid out and a have thoroughly enjoyed the delightful change of diet afforded me by the produce of this garden since my arrival I was also shown some barley which had been grown and which seemed to have a good car On the opposite slope is another clearance being prepared for sowing and between the two is a stream of good water which has been conveyed from a distance by an artificial channel The whole gives evidence of energetic interest and endeavours to make the most of the situation The only mineral wealth that has up till now been observed in the district which is geologically of coma datively recent volcanic origin is iron ore of good quality This is smelted out by the natives for the purpose of making their spear heads times and hoes for cultivating their plantations with and in addition they make a rough imitation of the i sentence or iron wire brought from the coast which forms such an important adjunct to their personal adornment From the country a will now turn to the people them selves who are ns I have already said a peeiiinrly bad and treacherous lot The men arc of medium stature very ugly and decidedly negroid in appearance They go naked with the exception of a small cloak of skin worn over one shoulder and their weapons are bows and poisoned arrows broadbladcd stabbing spears the sum and a buffalohide shield of large dimensions Brass and iron wire and beads are their chief ornaments and these are worn round the neck arms and wrist s and in the ears The women tooart by no means proposscssingin appeared ce They ape the Masai women a good deal in their dress being decently clothed in skins They also shave their heads and wear collars of brass and iron wire round their necks together with the spirallytwisted brass earrings which are affected by the Masai women They partake of the same thievish and cowardly nature as the men and by their wiles have on more than one occasion lured thoughtless porters to their deaths No traveller who has ever entered Kikuyu has had anything but a bad account to give of these wretches They have amply justified the character which has generally been given them and which has shown itself on several occasions since the company first established a station in their midst They are at deadly enmity with the Masai who have over and over again attempted to penetrate the forest fastnesses which surround the country but hitherto without success the WaKikuyu having proved more than a match for them on each occasion The aspect of affairs however is now considerably altered for the better under the vigorous administration of Captain Nelson who has taught the people one or t wo salutary lessons which they stood in great need of and which they arc notlikelv o forget in a hurry Waniaeko to whom T have already referred was at the bottom of ell the villainy that went on as has been proved by the statements made by the people since his death which occurred a short time ago He was directly responsible for the murder of several porters and for the attack made upon Mr Wilson who then commanded the former station at Dagoretii He would have treacherously murdered tho Euro peans and t he garrison stationed here at Fort Smith had he been able to do so His villainy however multi mately recoiled on his own fate and led to his death which took place in the following manner He appeared one day at the fort and began to jeer at Mr Pur kiss bout an attack which had been planned and carried out on the Kugulu a clan living to the north of the station The Itugulus had been guilty of the murder of the head man together with several porters sent out for the purpose of collecting food and the attack had failed owing to the treachery of Wnniackc who had given the people warn ng to retire Mr Puris knowing this ordered him out of the room Waniacke refused go and became so insolent that Mr Puris rose to put him out He thereupon drew his sime and made a cut at Mr Puris who closed with him wrenched the sword out of his hand and having got possession of it he cut Waniacke over the head with his own weapon giving him a severe wound Waniackc was put in chains and on his recovering sufficiently was despatched to the coast under an escort He died however at Kibwczi from dysentery on the road and the country was well rid of a thorough scoundrel The new Sultan is a very different kind of individual and is on excellent terms with the Europeans and seems to be a very decent fellow in every way a Much however remains to be done in this densely populated district which has need of more stations than one if the natives are to be thoroughly held in check ami the country rendered safe for the passage of small parties At present there is a force of some 150 men in the fort none too many and the most unceasing vigilance has to he exercised all round seeing that the natives cannot tic ti listed for a moment and may break out again at any Timi Caravans entering this district ire warned to he specially on their guard and under no circumstances are a few men to be detached for the purpose of sending messages or other work From what I gather the com any has thoughts of reducing the strength of the gar Rison which in my opinion would be the height of folly as in that ease the lives of the Europeans would not be worth much and the man who would remain m the country on those conditions would be a very foolhardy person Far from reducing the force they already have in the country they should place other forts and garrisons in the various districts Such retro guessive measures arc not calculated to effect substantial improvements amongst people like the WaKikuvu who would only too gladly avail themselves of their freedom from all restraint and their last state would be infinitely worse than the first Captain Nelson propounded what seemed to me a very sensible and feasible scheme of facilitate ing the transport of goods to Uganda at a very much reduced cost com pared with the present rates by a system of post stations along the route he himself undertaking to work this system from Machakos to Kavirondo were his force here to be in creased to 250 men There is no ostensible reason why a train of donkey wagons should not be run from Ma chaos up through the Masai country in the same manner as is practised in South Africa a This would be an immense saving in labour the country being in all respects suitable to the adoption of this method of I transport for only in very few places does it offer any a natural obstacles and these could easily be overcome by any one who was acquainted with the manage ment of this system of working As the company is at present endeavouring to economize in over way pos Sible in consequence of the additional great strain union their resources in occupying Uganda it would he well wort h their while to give attention to any such schemes which are likely to show a saving in the cost of transport and can in any wey help to relax the tension now being put upon them Shortly after my arrival at Fort Smith Dr Macpher son came in on his way to the coast from Munda where things seem to have been in a far from satisfy tory condition at the time of his departure Captain v claims had been very seriously ill from hreuiaturia and was anxious to leave ns soon as possible His health is in a critical state necessitating a thorough change

Pasha is that he became totally blind and died on bis way down the Congo but there is nothing to vouch for the authenticity of this rumour Another report states that he met his death at the hands of the Manyucnia slavehunters but here again there is nothing to prove the fact and mere rumours go for nothing out in Africa I myself have been dead before now a have to remain here for three or four days in order to collect skins from the Masai with which to make pack saddles for the donkeys that will have to accum any me in order to carry food as I intend going up the new route to Kavirondo This will necessitate my starting with of days food in hand There is no prospect of my writing again for some time to come as I do not know when where or how a still get another chance of sending further news down to the coast though I shall lose no opportune Ty of doing so The weather is fine and bright mv men have improved and things look generally more cheerful and satisfactoryThe Times EMIT PASHA A special correspondent of the Jterlitier Tun Hyatt in East Africa who telegraphed last July that Emit Pasha had been murdered has now sent a letter from Fort Knmpnli Ugmclndatl Dec of in which he report that Avail Trend formerly mnnagerof a magazine in Equatorial has made following statement On March a Emit Pasha marched with some Mane mas in the direction of the Congo after having con eluded blood brotherhood with an Arab named Divan a On the same day Awad left Emit to return to Kampala 17tk May 1893 and stayed twentyeight days with Kitunzi a drain of higher rank than the Chieftain Lavalli On April l he received from a brother of Masamboni known from Stanley description news that some Manyema who had bought ivory in his village had stated that the and all his people had been murdered by Manyema under Ismail a Yali of Said Ben Habib of Zanzibar on the River I tun abouttwo days march from Masambonie on March of or of The correspondent adds that this news became known at Kampala about the middle of August and was medially communicated to the British East Africa Company at Mombasa and that Mr Stokes was Iroha Bly at the tune of his writing between Toro or the Salt bake and Lavalli perhaps at Lavalli itself The cor respondent believed that Mr Stokes would send news of the incidents in question to Kampala as soon as lie heard anything trustworthy He adds that he would have sent express messengers for further information himself hail he been able to spare any of his five armed men In conclusion ho expresses the hope that the sad tidings of Emit s death may once more prove false In cherishing tins hope he is supported by the opinion of the most eminent experts here They do not believe that Emit a reason worthier incredulity is the success achieved by Kerkhoven against the Mahdists which would probably not have been so rapidly gained if Emit had not put him m connection with the natives This will also furnish a plausible explanation of the fact that no news

Despatches on the Zanzibar Protectorate one of which appeared in our columns yesterday are well worthy of study by the few who still doubt the advantages of British Rule in Africa Until the year 1800

chattels from the mainland disappeared tor years before we bad the formal right to dictate our will to the Sovereign Vet as Sir Gerald Portal tells us in his admirable summary of the financial status of Zanzibar there was not until the agreement recognising the Protectorate was signed in October 1891 any Government which could he called organised As in most Une fonned Oriental despotisms the Sultan was like Louis Quatorze the Government and the swarm of adventurers from Muscat ami the Hadramaut coast were the channels through which his revenue passed and it is unnecessary to add to which a large amount of it clung in transitu The Zanzibar Sultan had always been rich and though he made no pretence of keeping accounts while any thing which Could he termed statistics was undreamt of he could well afford to be robbed bv bis retainers Duties were levied not only on foreign goods but upon all the merchandise from the mainland as the only way of collecting taxes from the Arab ivory and slave traders who wandered through the dominions of the Sultan as far as Lake a anganyikawhich though discovered by Burton was well known to the caravan leaders long before he and Speke set forth to

second yielding a smaller round nut but also containing oil At present no exports arc made and the nuts appear to be only consumed as an article of food The cultivation is comparatively small and appears to be more particularly confined to the country lying between Dung and the capital In my opinion the cultivation of the product could be very largely extended the soil of the island being very suitable a the groundnut requiring a Deep rich soil of a grey colour a a a Cal caseous soil suits it best The yield is very large a In a good year the crop is 100 bushels an acre It is most profitable

crop form a most useful fodder which cattle are very fond often pical Agriculturist September of Groundnuts are becoming an important and valuable export and an increased demand has sprung up Marseilles being the principal centre a I understood that the chief reason for the small j present cultivation is that it is very exhausting crop certainly not more so than a cassava and this objection does not apparently carry great weight with the native cultivators in the eastern districts of Southern India from which the annual exports of groundnuts are very large And it would certainly be a great step in advance if the profits derived from the export of this product were to induce landowners to pay greater attention and care to the upkeep of their fields The Imperial British East Africa Company recognising the special importance of this cultive ton has imported some seed from India the Indian variety being larger than the local kind Oil Plants Reference to groundnuts brings me naturally toil plants Sesame or gingelly does not appear to be cultivated in the extensive manner carried on on the mainland and altogether oil plant cultivations appear an

Delcommune who with bis surviving com fanions lias just arrived in Belgium has issued a summary of bis discoveries They complete those of Livingstone Cameron and Stanley to the north and of Reinhardt Capello and Ivens to the south comprising as they do the sources of the Congo and the course of its principal affluents The Congo issues from a chain of mountains which extends from the shores of the southern extremity f the Tanganyika Lake to the extreme north of the Nyassa It forms in those countries a river called the Tehambcsi discovered in the course THE GAZETTE a of the last century by a Portuguese traveller a Lacerta and forms the chief affluent of a Lake Angelo The waters of the Angelo a descend from a height of 1100 metres into a Lake Mero 000 metres above the level of a the sea by means of the River Luapala 300 kilo a metres long which is a succession of rapids The j Monro constitutes a second reservoir and sends j forth a stream 800 metres broad which reaches the J village of Ankorro by a series of waterfalls At a this point it becomes navigable receiving upon its j western bank the Lualaba also navigable whose a waters have been swollen in the a turn by the Lungs I and the Lovoa on the western the Lucia on the eastern bank and by the discharge of the Lakes a Kabele Pemba and Kassala Between the th and th degrees of latitude the Congo receives on the rigid the Lukuga which draws off the overflow of Lake Tanganyika as described by Cameron and Stanley M Delcommune confirms the assertions of these explorers that the Lukuga is an unimportant waterway as its course is obstructed and only flows freely when the waters of the Tanganyika are exceptionally high The Luapalu on the a contrary empties Lake Angelo which was formerly an inland sea but is now bordered by vast swamps When the Congo finally reaches Nyangwe it measures some 1200 metres from bank to bank Lake Landri though marked on the maps according to the reports of the Arabs has no existence M Delcommune

EC under the presidency of Mr David F Carmichael The Chairman after expressing the satisfaction the Board felt at meeting the shareholders stated that by transfer from Mr Parspnson their vendor they stood in respect of the extensive grant made to him as concessionaires under the Mozambique Company to whom in July 1892 under a charter of the King of Portugal the administration of the provinces of Mania and Sofa were formally handed over a a territory with an area greater than that of England and Wales stretching from the River Zambesi to the Safi with 200 miles of coast line and possessing the splendid harbourPungwe Bay It was certified by their Directors under the band of the Mozambique Company Secretary glia the exceptionally favourable terms under which this concession wnsgi anted were solely due to certain value able services rendered to them by Mr Parsons and that it was unlikely that any other such grant would be made on equally favourable terms The area comprised some 380 square miles in a country with an altitude of 2r00 ft extraordinary fertile with a climate well suited to Europeans and possessing every indication of mineral wealth According to the terms the farms and town lots were transferred free of charge a for two years from the registration of the Company no quitrent was chargeable a after that id per annum for every hectare or every acres On the whole 380 square miles the quitrent would not exceed 400 a year The with May 1893 property was held in perpetuity with liberty to transfer any portion of it to any individual or corporation The shareholders would understand that no political administrative or fiscal rights were transferred a but it was not improbable that the Mozambique Company might at first offer to their servants certain administrative duties till the country was opened out They should think it an honour and find it an advantage that they should be entrusted with such duties as they already thought it an honour and found it an advantage to them that two of the Mozambique Companythe Marquis de Aiello and Mr C Algernon Moreinghad accepted a seats on their Board Mr Mornings experience I had been of the greatest assistance to them a they a recognised him and their Portuguese colleague as the leaders of that liberal and progressive policy which was visible in the administration of the most important colony in Portuguese East Africa a policy which included the construction of railroads and other public works the laying out of towns the encouragement of a disciplined police force and competent tribunals As to their financial position the Directors deteminednot to go to allotment unless the public came in with 10000 at least This they obtained and they had called up half of it Up to the present their expenditure amounted to about 3000 the greater part of which was for the necessary equipment of their staff In conclusion the Chairman dwelt at some length upon the personnel of their expedition Captain Spring in reply to a shareholder said that he did not think they would clash with the Zambesi Gaza and Zambesi Sofa Companies because all those Companies as far as he understood them had not yet located their claims a they had an existence but no localisation Mr Morning then addressed the meeting He said that the Premier Concessions were about to take up a large block of land in the very choicest part of the Mozambique Company territories and that Company was anxious that the venture should prove successful so as to be an example to others who lie hoped would follow rapidly in their foot steps although not on such favourable terms There was of course a certain risk incurred as the country was in a part of Africa which was unknown to the English people The Directors had organised an excellent expedition and in fact had done every thing possible to ensure a favourable issue On the motion of Captain Hyper a vote of thanks to the Chairman closed the proceedingsSouth Africa CENTRAL AFRICA a The accusations levelled by the Belgian Anti Slavery Association and by Mr Stanley to the effect that the Arabs on the Congo have been supplied with arms and ammunition from German East Africa in contravention of the Brussels General Act arc most categorically denied at Berlin Thorough inquiries have been instituted and the result lias been to prove that no breechloaders or any precise weapons are traded with in the German sphere of interest A further refutation of these accusations is afforded by a letter from Dr Stull Mann the African explorer who remarks that the guns supplied to the caravans are very secondrater muzzleloaders with short barrels with which accurate shooting is an impossibility The powder is of like quality and the charge is made up of bits of iron shot and small leaden bullets the latter of which never fit the bore of the rifle If the caravans could not buy anus of any sort the Government would have to provide military escorts which is not to he thought of Fresh and more detailed reports as to the death of Emm Pasha have been received in Berlin It is affirmed that on the with of March last year Emit ana all his followers were murdered in

accounts for the last two years to which is added an exhaustive report of the undertakings set on foot in German East Africa Of the original capital of nearly 2100000 marks obtained by a lottery and private subscriptions more than a million and a half has been expended of which the Wissmaim expedition absorbed 60000 marks without accomplishing its primary object The Weissmann steamer which it will be remember ed is to be left on Lake Nyassa will be handed over to the Imperial administration The German station says the report will be erected at the southern end of the lake where the English Government has granted a suitable site and a fortified harbour is to be constructed later at the northern end of the lake in German territory With the small tug Arrogant other smaller vessels a regular communication will he establish ed between Lake Nyassa and the mouths of the Zambesi When this is accomplished it will he possible to make the first move against the strong holds of the slave trade which finds its chief support in the Yaos who live in German territory and against the continuation of which the English Government is still almost powerless THE FRENCH IN AFRICA General Dodds
