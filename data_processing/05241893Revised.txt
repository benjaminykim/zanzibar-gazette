OF 

the gazette 

fever mosquito AND other disagreeables finding no field 
for their operations in this pure atmosphere the people 
were formerly rich in cattle until the plague which 
decimated their herds made its appearance a short time 
ago even now they have plenty of sheep and goats 
whoso flesh is excellent eating owing to the rich 
pasturage on which they browse the station itself is 
well supplied with cattle sheep and goats as well as 
donkeys which have been purchased from the masai 
the cattle enclosure is outside the fort and is strongly 
constructed of stout pointed palisades and the interior 
is arranged with a view of securing the health and 
comfort of its inmates on the lower part of the southern 
aspect of the hill on which the fort is built a 
wellstocked garden of english vegetables HAS been laid out 
and I have thoroughly enjoyed the delightful change of 
diet afforded me by the produce of this garden since my 
arrival i was also shown some barley which had been 
grown and which seemed to have a good car on the 
opposite slope is another clearance being prepared for 
sowing and between the two is a stream of good water 
which has been conveyed from a distance by an artificial 
channel the whole gives evidence of energetic interest 
and endeavours to make the most of the situation 
the only mineral wealth that has up till now been 
observed in the district which is geologically of 
comparatively recent volcanic origin is iron ore of good 
quality this is smelted out by the natives for the 
purpose of making their spear heads TIMES and hoes for 
cultivating their plantations with and in addition they 
make a rough imitation of the i SENTENCE or iron wire 
brought from the coast which forms such an important 
adjunct to their personal adornment 
from the country I will now turn to the people 
themselves who are AS i have already said a peeiiinrly bad 
and treacherous lot the men ARE of medium stature 
very ugly and decidedly negroid in appearance they 
go naked with the exception of a small cloak of skin 
worn over one shoulder and their weapons are bows and 
poisoned arrows broad-bladed stabbing spears the 
and a buffalo-hide shield of large dimensions brass and 
iron wire and beads are their chief ornaments and these 
are worn round the neck arms and wrist s and in the ears 
the women TOOART by no means proposscssingin 
appearance they ape the masai women a good deal in their dress 
BEING decently clothed in skins they also shave their 
heads and wear collars of brass and iron wire round their 
necks together with the spirally-twisted brass earrings 
which are affected by the masai women they partake 
of the same thievish and cowardly nature as the men 
and by their wiles have on more than one occasion lured 
thoughtless porters to their deaths no traveller who 
has ever entered kikuyu has had anything but a bad 
account to give of these wretches they have amply 
justified the character which has generally been given 
them and which has shown itself on several occasions 
since the company first established a station in their 
midst they are at deadly enmity with the masai who 
have over and over again attempted to penetrate the 
forest fastnesses which surround the country but hitherto 
without success the having proved more 
than a match for them on each occasion the aspect of 
affairs however is now considerably altered for the better 
under the vigorous administration of captain nelson who 
has taught the people one or t wo salutary lessons which 
they stood in great need of and which they ARE notlikelv 
o forget in a hurry 
waniaeko to whom t have already referred was at the 
bottom of ell the villainy that went on as has been 
proved by the statements made by the people since 
his death which occurred a short time ago he 
was directly responsible for the murder of several 
porters and for the attack made upon mr wilson 
who then commanded the former station at dagoretii 
he would have treacherously murdered tho 
peans and t he garrison stationed here at fort smith 
had he been able to do so his villainy however 
ultimately recoiled on his own fate and led to his death 
which took place in the following manner he appeared 
one day at the fort and began to jeer at mr pur kiss 
bout an attack which had been planned and carried 
out on the kugulu a clan living to the north of the 
station the itugulus had been guilty of the murder of 
the head man together with several porters sent out for 
the purpose of collecting food and the attack had failed 
owing to the treachery of wnniackc who had given the 
people WARN ng to retire mr PURIS knowing this 
ordered him out of the room waniacke REFUSED go 
and became so insolent that mr PURIS rose to put him 
out he thereupon drew his sime and made a cut 
at mr PURIS who closed with him wrenched the 
sword out of his hand and having got possession of it 
he cut waniacke over the head with his own weapon 
giving him a severe wound waniackc was put in chains 
and on his recovering sufficiently was despatched to the 
coast under an escort he died however at kibwczi from 
dysentery on the road and the country was well rid of a 
thorough scoundrel the new sultan is a very different 
kind of individual and is on excellent terms with the 
europeans and seems to be a very decent fellow in every 
way a 

much however remains to be done in this 
denselypopulated district which has need of more stations than 
one if the natives are to be thoroughly held in check AND 
the country rendered safe for the passage of small parties 
at present there is a force of some 150 men in the fort 
none too many and the most unceasing vigilance has 
to he exercised all round seeing that the natives cannot 
tic ti listed for a moment and may break out again at any 
TIMI CARAVANS entering this district ire warned to he 
specially on their guard and under no circumstances are 
a few men to be detached for the purpose of SENDING 
messages or other work from what i gather the com 
ANY has thoughts of reducing the strength of the 
garrison which in my opinion would be the height of folly 
as in that ease the lives of the europeans would 
not be worth much and the man who would remain 
m the country on those conditions would be a very 
foolhardy person far from reducing the force they 
already have in the country they should place other 
forts and garrisons in the various districts such 
retrogressive measures ARE not calculated to effect substantial 
improvements amongst people like the who 
would only too gladly avail themselves of their 
freedom from all restraint and their last state 
would be infinitely worse than the first captain nelson 
propounded what seemed to me a very sensible and 
feasible scheme of FACILITATE ing the transport of goods to 
uganda at a very much reduced cost com pared with the 
present rates by a system of post stations along the 
route he himself undertaking to work this system from 
machakos to kavirondo were his force here to be 
increased to 250 men there is no ostensible reason why 
a train of donkey wagons should not be run from 
SHAKOS up through the masai country in the same 
manner as is practised in south africa this would be 
an immense saving in labour the country being in all 
respects suitable to the adoption of this method of i 
transport for only in very few places does it offer any I 
natural obstacles and these could easily be overcome 
by any one who was acquainted with the 
management of this system of working as the company is at 
present endeavouring to economize in OVER way 
possible in consequence of the additional great strain UNION 
their resources in occupying uganda it would he well 
wort h their while to give attention to any such schemes 
which are likely to show a saving in the cost of 
transport and can in any wey help to relax the tension 
now being put upon them 
shortly after my arrival at fort smith dr 
son came in on his way to the coast from MUNDA 
where things seem to have been in a far from 
satisfactory condition at the time of his departure captain 
v CLAIMS had been very seriously ill from hreuiaturia 
and was anxious to leave AS soon as possible his health is 
in a critical state necessitating a thorough change so 
that in all probability i may meet him on his way 
down major smith and his party hail arrived in 
kavirondo at kwa SUNDA on november OF having 
come down rid BARING dr MACPHERSON had seen or 
heard nothing about either captain MACDONALD r e 
or bishop tucker and the mission caravan AS they had 
gone up by the new route over mau escarpments 
though t hey must doubtless have arrived before this in 
kayirondo dr mncphcrsons arrival is most timely 
captain nelson who i trust will now make oral

MEDICAL treatment 
the latest information about EMIT pasha is that he 
became totally blind and died on bis way down the 
congo but there is nothing to vouch for the authenticity 
of this rumour another report states that he met his 
death at the hands of the manyucnia slave-hunters but 
here again there is nothing to prove the fact and mere 
rumours go for nothing out in africa i myself have 
been dead before now 
I have to remain here for three or four DAYS in order 
to collect skins from the masai with which to make 
pack saddles for the donkeys that will have to 
accompany me in order to carry food as i intend going 
up the new route to kavirondo this will necessitate 
my starting with OF days food in hand there is 
no prospect of my writing again for some time to 
come as i do not know when where or how I 
STILL get another chance of sending further news 
down to the coast though i shall lose no 
opportunity of doing so the weather is fine and bright mv 
men have improved and things look GENERALLY more 
cheerful and satisfactorythe times 

EMIT pasha 

a special correspondent of the jterlitier tun LATT in 
east africa who telegraphed last july that EMIT pasha 
had been murdered has now sent a letter from fort 
knmpnli ugmclndatl dec OF in which he 
THAT avail TREND FORMERLY mnnagerof a magazine in 
EQUATORIAL has made following statement 
on march A EMIT pasha marched with some MANE 
mas in the direction of the congo after having con 
eluded blood brotherhood with an arab named DIVAN 
on the same day ACAD left EMIT to return to kampala 

17tk may 
1893and stayed twenty-eight days with kitunzi a DRAIN 
of higher rank than the chieftain LAVALLI on april l 
he received from a brother of masamboni known from 
STANLEY description news that some MANYEMA who 
had bought ivory in his village had stated that the and 
all his people had been murdered by MANYEMA under 
ISMAIL a yali of said ben HABIB of zanzibar on the 
river i tun about-two days march from masambonie on 
OF or OF 
the correspondent adds that this news became known 
at kampala about the middle of august and was 
MEDIALLY communicated to the british east africa 
company at mombasa and that mr stokes was 
PROBABLY at the tune of his writing between toro or the salt 
bake and LAVALLI perhaps at LAVALLI itself the 
correspondent believed that mr stokes would send news of 
the incidents in question to kampala as soon as lie heard 
anything trustworthy he adds that he would have 
sent express messengers for further information himself 
hail he been able to spare any of his five armed men in 
conclusion ho expresses the hope that the sad tidings of 
EMIT s death may once more prove false in cherishing 
tins hope he is supported by the opinion of the most 
eminent experts here they do not believe that EMIT 
REASON WORTHIER incredulity is the success 
achieved by KERKHOVEN against the MAHDISTS which would 
probably not have been so rapidly gained if EMIT had 
not put him m connection with the natives this will 
also furnish a plausible explanation of the fact that no 
news about EMIT has arrived since august or 
hrnnhvv8 impossible for him to send letters 
directly from the upper nile

interview with a central news reporter said I 
propose to farm a township as near as possible to

constructed and an english community will soon be 
located upon the spot where gmgunlmna once had 
las kraal farms are to be laid out at once by our 
surveyor mr gan-and and exploration parties 
will be formed to prospect for gold and other 
precious metals with which the district abounds 
i know the whole country and have no fear for 
the health of the expedition otherwise i should 
not he taking my wife with me the coast at 
certain points is not inviting hat the elevated 
plateaus inland are especially salubrious as a 
matter of fact this new settlement will be in 
better touch with english than many of the more 
widely-known south african settlements and I 
confidently expect a great influx of white 
population into THIS favoured land within a very short 
period i am convinced that it will become 
industrially and commercially important

progress in zanzibar 

tile despatches on the zanzibar protectorate 
one of which appeared in our columns yesterday 
are well worthy of study by the few who still doubt 
the advantages of british rule in africa until the 
year 1800 our influence in the arab sultans 
dominions was simply that of the nation doing the 
greatest amount of business with his capital and 
whose political agent had most readily the ear of 
the ruler this prevented any serious outrages 
taking placeopenly and thanks to the treaty 
which sir BARTLE FRERE somewhat forcibly persuaded 
SEND BURGAS to sign the old slave market and the 
dhows full of black chattels from the mainland 
disappeared tor years before we bad the formal 
right to dictate our will to the sovereign vet as 
sir gerald portal tells us in his admirable summary 
of the financial status of zanzibar there was not 
until the agreement recognising the protectorate 
was signed in october 1891 any government 
which could he called organised as in most 
unrefonned oriental despotisms the sultan was like 
louis quatorze the government and the swarm 
of adventurers from muscat AND the HADRAMAUT 
coast were the channels through which his 
revenue passed and it is unnecessary to add to 
which a large amount of it clung in transitu the 
zanzibar sultan had always been rich and though 
he made no pretence of keeping accounts while 
any thing which could he termed statistics was 
undreamt of he could well AFFORD to be robbed bv 
bis retainers duties were levied not only on foreign 
goods but upon all the merchandise from the 
mainland as the only way of collecting taxes from 
the arab ivory and slave traders who wandered 
through the dominions of the sultan as far as lake 
I anganyikawhich though discovered by burton 
was well known to the caravan leaders long before 
he and SPEKE set forth to find it every slave paid 
two dollars a head to the sultan and his private 
chest was the sole government treasury ivory AND 
SUM also contributed to his revenue and the clove

while at cairo had become familiar with the ways

better way of controlling a kingdom than that

irregular soldiers retainers and miscellaneous

of a great many of them is an economy which 
should be advantageous in every way some of

a variety of this is to be found in most native

not think is the true arrowroot maranta 
arundinacca the shape of the leaves differing though 
the preparation of the roots appears to be the same 
WANGA bearing a fleshy knotty root which is 
ground and washed in repeated waters and finally 
SUNDRIED this preparation mixed with sugar 
forms a favourite sweetmeat with the arabs 
i see no reason why arrowroot should not be 
more extensively cultivated on the island and form 
an article of export the cultivation is easy and 
immediate returns are obtained 
the plants are propagated by parting the roots

GROUND nut 

of TAIF GROUNDNUT ai FICHU hjipoyna two 
varieties ARE known locally MANGE NYASSA JUG 
MADE 
the first is the GROUNDNUT of commerce the 
second yielding a smaller round nut but also 
containing oil 
at present no exports ARE made and the nuts 
appear to be only consumed as an article of food 
the cultivation is comparatively small and 
appears to be more particularly confined to the 
country lying between DUNG and the capital 
in my opinion the cultivation of the product 
could be very largely extended the soil of the 
island being very suitable the GROUNDNUT requiring 
deep rich soil of a grey colour 
CASEOUS soil suits it best 
the yield is very large 
in a good year the crop is 100 bushels an acre 
it is most profitable CROPPED are more so 
the seeds contain OF per cent to per cent 
of oilhaldanes subtropical cultivation 
professor CHURCH analysis of the GROUNDNUT 
arachinjtipofuji shows that it contains of water 
OF albuminoids starch fibre 
OF ash OF the oil which forms such a large 
PROPORTION of the GROUNDNUT is of a pale clear 
straw color it will not become rancid and improves 
with age it is known in commerce as nut oil 
and is not only adulterated with but is substituted 
for olive oil it is valuable as a lubricant for 
delicate machinery the stems of the 
plant after removal of the crop form a most 
useful fodder which cattle are very fond 
pical agriculturist september OF 
GROUNDNUTS are becoming an important and 
valuable export and an increased demand has 
sprung up marseilles being the principal centre 
i understood that the chief reason for the small j 
present cultivation is that it is very exhausting 
crop certainly not more so than cassava and 
this objection does not apparently carry great 
weight with the native cultivators in the eastern 
districts of southern india from which the annual 
exports of GROUNDNUTS are very large 
and it would certainly be a great step in advance 
if the profits derived from the export of this product 
were to induce landowners to pay greater attention 
and care to the upkeep of their fields 
the imperial british east africa company 
recognising the special importance of this 
cultivation has imported some seed from india the 
indian variety being larger than the local kind 

oil plants 

reference to GROUNDNUTS brings me naturally 
TOIL plants sesame or gingelly does not appear to 
be cultivated in the extensive manner carried on on 
the mainland and altogether oil plant cultivations 
appear an entirely secondary matter 
BONO is a variety of oil plant yielding oil 
from the seed it is not largely cultivated being 
chiefly grown in gardens and t he neighbourhood of 
houses its leaves in conjunction with those of 
the BANI being also used medicinally for 
stopping the bleeding of cuts and wounds 
the oil plant is also found on the island

lukuga is an unimportant waterway as its course 
is obstructed and only flows freely when the 
waters of the tanganyika are exceptionally high 
the luapalu on the contrary empties lake

premier concessions of 

mozambique 

the first statutory general meeting of the 
premier concessions of mozambique LIMB ted 
was held recently at broad street house old 
broad street ec under the presidency of mr 
david f CARMICHAEL 
the chairman after expressing the satisfaction 
the board felt at meeting the shareholders stated 
that by transfer from mr parspnson their vendor 
they stood in respect of the extensive grant made 
to him as concessionaires under the mozambique 
company to whom in july 1892 under a charter 
of the king of portugal the administration of the 
provinces of MANIA and SOFA were formally 
handed over a territory with an area greater than 
that of england and wales stretching from the 
river ZAMBESI to the SAFI with 200 miles of coast 
line and possessing the splendid harbourpungwe 
bay it was certified by their directors under the 
band of the mozambique COMPANY secretary TSIA 
the exceptionally favourable terms under which this 
concession wnsgi anted were solely due to certain 
valuable services rendered to them by mr PARSONS and 
that it was unlikely that any other such grant would 
be made on equally favourable terms the area 
comprised some 380 square miles in a country with 
an altitude of 2r00 ft extraordinary fertile with a 
climate well suited to europeans and possessing every 
indication of mineral wealth according to the 
terms the farms and town lots were transferred free 
of charge for two years from the registration of 
the company no QUITRENT was chargeable after 
that id per annum for every hectare or every 
acres on the whole 380 square miles the 
QUITRENT would not exceed 400 a year the 

WITH may 1893 
property was held in perpetuity with liberty to 
transfer any portion of it to any individual or 
corporation the shareholders would understand 
that no political administrative or fiscal rights 
were transferred but it was not improbable that the 
mozambique company might at first offer to their 
servants certain administrative duties till the country 
was opened out they should think it an honour and 
find it an advantage that they should be entrusted 
with such duties as they already thought it an 
honour and found it an advantage to them that 
two of the mozambique companythe marquis de 
AIELLO and mr c ALGERNON moreinghad accepted 
seats on their board mr MORNINGS experience 
i had been of the greatest assistance to them they 
recognised him and their portuguese colleague as 
the leaders of that liberal and progressive policy 
which was visible in the administration of the most 
important colony in portuguese east africa a 
policy which included the construction of railroads 
and other public works the laying out of towns 
the encouragement of a disciplined police force and 
competent tribunals as to their financial position 
the directors deteminednot to go to allotment unless 
the public came in with 10000 at least this they 
obtained and they had called up half of it up to 
the present their expenditure amounted to about 
3000 the greater part of which was for the 
necessary equipment of their staff in conclusion 
the chairman dwelt at some length upon the 
personnel of their expedition 
captain spring in reply to a shareholder said 
that he did not think they would clash with the 
ZAMBESI GAZA and ZAMBESI SOFA companies 
because all those COMPANIES as far as he understood 
them had not yet located their claims they had an 
existence but no localisation 
mr MORNING then addressed the meeting he 
said that the premier concessions were about to 
take up a large block of land in the very choicest 
part of the mozambique COMPANY territories and 
that company was anxious that the venture should 
prove successful so as to be an example to others 
who lie hoped would follow rapidly in their 
footsteps although not on such favourable terms 
there was of course a certain risk incurred as the 
country was in a part of africa which was unknown 
to the english people the directors had organised 
an excellent expedition and in fact had done 
everything possible to ensure a favourable issue 
on the motion of captain HYPER a vote of thanks 
to the chairman closed the proceedingssouth

effect that the arabs on the congo have been

thorough inquiries have been instituted and the 
result HAS been to prove that no breechloaders or 
any precise weapons are traded with in the german

accusations is afforded by a letter from dr 
MANN the african explorer who remarks that the 
guns supplied to the caravans are very second-rate 
MUZZLELOADERS with short barrels with which 
accurate shooting is an impossibility the powder 
is of like quality and the charge is made up of bits 
of iron shot and small leaden bullets the latter of 
which never fit the bore of the rifle if the 
caravans could not buy anus of any sort the
