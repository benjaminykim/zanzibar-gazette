for their operations in this pure atmosphere the people 
were formerly rich in cattle until the plague which 
decimated their herds made its appearance a short time 
ago even now they have plenty of sheep and goats 
whoso flesh is excellent eating owing to the rich 
pasturage on which they browse the station itself is 
well supplied with cattle sheep and goats as well as 
donkeys which have been purchased from the masai 
the cattle enclosure is outside the fort and is strongly 
constructed of stout pointed palisades and the interior 
is arranged with a view of securing the health and 
comfort of its inmates on the lower part of the southern 
aspect of the hill on which the fort is built a 
wellstocked garden of english vegetables HAS been laid out 
and A-I** have thoroughly enjoyed the delightful change of 
diet afforded me by the produce of this garden since my

and endeavours to make the most of the situation 
the only mineral wealth that has up till now been 
observed in the district which is geologically of 
comparatively recent volcanic origin is iron ore of good 
quality this is smelted out by the natives for the 
purpose of making their spear heads TIMES-SIMES** and hoes for 
cultivating their plantations with and in addition they

BEING decently clothed in skins they also shave their 
heads and wear collars of brass and iron wire round their 
necks together with the spirallytwisted-SPIRALLY-TWISTED brass earrings 
which are affected by the masai women they partake 
of the same thievish and cowardly nature as the men 
and by their wiles have on more than one occasion lured 
thoughtless porters to their deaths no traveller who 
has ever entered kikuyu has had anything but a bad 
account to give of these wretches they have amply 
justified the character which has generally been given 
them and which has shown itself on several occasions 
since the company first established a station in their 
midst they are at deadly enmity with the masai who 
have over and over again attempted to penetrate the 
forest fastnesses which surround the country but hitherto 
without success the wakikuyu-WA-KIKUYU** having proved more 
than a match for them on each occasion the aspect of 
affairs however is now considerably altered for the better 
under the vigorous administration of captain nelson-CAPTAIN NELSON** who 
has taught the people one or t wo-TWO** salutary lessons which 
they stood in great need of and which they ARE notlikelv-NOT LIKELY** 
o(IS ‘O’ IN ORIGINAL) forget in a hurry 
waniaeko-WANIAKE** to whom t-I** have already referred was at the 
bottom of ell-ALL** the villainy that went on as has been 
proved by the statements made by the people since 
his death which occurred a short time ago he 
was directly responsible for the murder of several 
porters and for the attack made upon mr wilson 
who then commanded the former station at dagoretii-DAGORETI** 
he would have treacherously murdered tho-THE** 
europeans and t he-THE** garrison stationed here at fort smith 
had he been able to do so his villainy however 
ultimately recoiled on his own fate and led to his death 
which took place in the following manner he appeared 
one day at the fort and began to jeer at mr pur kiss-PURKISS** 
bout an attack which had been planned and carried 
out on the kugulu-RUGULU** a clan living to the north of the 
station the itugulus-RUGULUS** had been guilty of the murder of 
the head man together with several porters sent out for 
the purpose of collecting food and the attack had failed 
owing to the treachery of wnniackc-WANIACKE** who had given the 
people WARN ng-WARNING** to retire mr PURIS-PURKISS** knowing this 
ordered him out of the room waniacke REFUSED go 
and became so insolent that mr PURIS-PUKISS** rose to put him 
out he thereupon drew his sime and made a cut 
at mr PURIS-PURKISS** who closed with him wrenched the 
sword out of his hand and having got possession of it 
he cut waniacke over the head with his own weapon 
giving him a severe wound waniackc-WANIAKE** was put in chains 
and on his recovering sufficiently was despatched to the 
coast under an escort he died however at kibwczi-KIBWEZI from 
dysentery on the road and the country was well rid of a 
thorough scoundrel the new sultan is a very different 
kind of individual and is on excellent terms with the 
europeans and seems to be a very decent fellow in every 
way a 

much however remains to be done in this 
denselypopulated-DENSLEY-POPULATED** district which has need of more stations than 
one if the natives are to be thoroughly held in check AND 
the country rendered safe for the passage of small parties 
at present there is a force of some 150 men in the fort 
none too many and the most unceasing vigilance has 
to he exercised all round seeing that the natives cannot 
tic ti listed for a moment and may break out again at any 
TIMI-TIME** CARAVANS entering this district ire-ARE** warned to he-BE** 
specially on their guard and under no circumstances are 
a few men to be detached for the purpose of SENDING 
messages or other work from what i gather the com 
ANY-COMPANY** has thoughts of reducing the strength of the 
garrison which in my opinion would be the height of folly 
as in that ease-CASE** the lives of the europeans would 
not be worth much and the man who would remain 
m the country on those conditions would be a very 
foolhardy person far from reducing the force they 
already have in the country they should place other 
forts and garrisons in the various districts such 
retrogressive measures ARE not calculated to effect substantial 
improvements amongst people like the wakikuvu-WA-KIKUYU** who 
would only too gladly avail themselves of their 
freedom from all restraint and their last state 
would be infinitely worse than the first captain nelson 
propounded what seemed to me a very sensible and 
feasible scheme of FACILITATE ing-FACILITATING** the transport of goods to 
uganda-UGANDA** at a very much reduced cost com pared-COMPARED** with the 
present rates by a system of post stations along the 
route he himself undertaking to work this system from 
machakos-MACHAKOS*** to kavirondo-KAVIRONDO*** were his force here to be 
increased to 250 men there is no ostensible reason why 
a train of donkey wagons should not be run from 
machakos up through the masai country in the same 
manner as is practised in south africa A-** this would be 
an immense saving in labour the country being in all 
respects suitable to the adoption of this method of I-** 
transport for only in very few places does it offer any A 
natural obstacles and these could easily be overcome 
by any one who was acquainted with the 
management of this system of working as the company is at 
present endeavouring to economize in OVER-EVERY** way 
possible in consequence of the additional great strain UNION-UPON** 
their resources in occupying uganda it would he-BE** well

which are likely to show a saving in the cost of 
transport and can in any wey-(WEY IN DOC, SHOULD BE WAY)** help to relax the tension

EMIT-EMIN** pasha 

a special correspondent of the jterlitier-BERLINER** tun KLATT-TUGEBLATT** in 
east africa who telegraphed last july that EMIT-EMIN** pasha 
had been murdered has now sent a letter from fort

of higher rank than the chieftain LAVALLI-KAVALLI** on april l 
he received from a brother of masamboni-MASAMBONI** known from 
STANLEY-STANLEY’S** description news that some MANYEMA-MANYEMAS** who 
had bought ivory in his village had stated that the and

the correspondent adds that this news became known 
at kampala about the middle of august and was 
MEDIALLY-OFFICIALLY** communicated to the british east africa 
company at mombasa and that mr stokes was 
PROBABLY at the tune-TIME** of his writing between toro or the salt 
bake-LAKE** and LAVALLI-KAVALLI** perhaps at LAVALLI-KAVALLI** itself the 
correspondent believed that mr stokes would send news of

anything trustworthy he adds that he would have 
sent express messengers for further information himself 
hail he been able to spare any of his five armed men in 
conclusion ho-HE** expresses the hope that the sad tidings of 
EMIT s-EMIN’S** death may once more prove false in cherishing 
tins hope he is supported by the opinion of the most 
eminent experts here they do not believe that EMIT-EMIN IS DEAD** 
A-ONE** REASON WORTHIER-FOR THEIR** incredulity is the success 
achieved by KERKHOVEN-KERCHOVEN** against the MAHDISTS which would 
probably not have been so rapidly gained if EMIT-EMIN** had

also furnish a plausible explanation of the fact that no

the first statutory general meeting of the 
premier concessions of mozambique LIMB ted-LIMITED** 
was held recently at broad street house old 
broad street ec under the presidency of mr 
david f CARMICHAEL 
the chairman after expressing the satisfaction 
the board felt at meeting the shareholders stated 
that by transfer from mr parspnson-PARSONSON** their vendor 
they stood in respect of the extensive grant made 
to him as concessionaires under the mozambique 
company to whom in july 1892 under a charter 
of the king of portugal the administration of the 
provinces of MANIA-MANICA** and SOFA-SOFALA** were formally 
handed over A-;** a territory with an area greater than 
that of england and wales stretching from the 
river ZAMBESI to the SAFI-SABI** with 200 miles of coast 
line and possessing the splendid harbourpungwe-HARBOUR- PUNGWE** 
bay it was certified by their directors under the 
band of the mozambique COMPANY secretary THIA-THAT** 
the exceptionally favourable terms under which this 
concession wnsgi anted-WAS GRANTED** were solely due to certain 
valuable services rendered to them by mr PARSONS and 
that it was unlikely that any other such grant would 
be made on equally favourable terms the area 
comprised some 380 square miles in a country with 
an altitude of 2r00-2500* ft extraordinary fertile with a 
climate well suited to europeans and possessing every 
indication of mineral wealth according to the 
terms the farms and town lots were transferred free 
of charge A-;** for two years from the registration of 
the company no quitrent was chargeable A-;** after 
that id-1D** per annum for every hectare or every 
acres on the whole 380 square miles the 
QUITRENT would not exceed 400 a year the 

WITH-24TH** may 1893 
property was held in perpetuity with liberty to 
transfer any portion of it to any individual or 
corporation the shareholders would understand 
that no political administrative or fiscal rights 
were transferred A-;** but it was not improbable that the 
mozambique company might at first offer to their 
servants certain administrative duties till the country 
was opened out they should think it an honour and 
find it an advantage that they should be entrusted 
with such duties as they already thought it an 
honour and found it an advantage to them that

A-** seats on their board mr MORNINGS-MOREING’S** experience 
I-** had been of the greatest assistance to them A-;** they 
A-** recognised him and their portuguese colleague as 
the leaders of that liberal and progressive policy 
which was visible in the administration of the most 
important colony in portuguese east africa a 
policy which included the construction of railroads 
and other public works the laying out of towns 
the encouragement of a disciplined police force and 
competent tribunals as to their financial position 
the directors deteminednot-DETERMINED NOT** to go to allotment unless 
the public came in with 10000 at least this they 
obtained and they had called up half of it up to 
the present their expenditure amounted to about 
3000 the greater part of which was for the 
necessary equipment of their staff in conclusion 
the chairman dwelt at some length upon the 
personnel of their expedition 
captain spring in reply to a shareholder said 
that he did not think they would clash with the 
ZAMBESI GAZA and ZAMBESI SOFA-SOFALA** companies 
because all those COMPANIES as far as he understood 
them had not yet located their claims A-;** they had an 
existence but no localisation 
mr MORNING-MOREING** then addressed the meeting he 
said that the premier concessions were about to 
take up a large block of land in the very choicest 
part of the mozambique COMPANY territories and 
that company was anxious that the venture should 
prove successful so as to be an example to others 
who lie-HE** hoped would follow rapidly in their 
footsteps although not on such favourable terms 
there was of course a certain risk incurred as the 
country was in a part of africa which was unknown 
to the english people the directors had organised 
an excellent expedition and in fact had done 
everything possible to ensure a favourable issue
