21/A February. 

The Waii. In view of the indecisive war 
operations and the intense cold and also the 
exhaustion both physically and financially of 
Turkey and the Allies, the idea of effective 
mediation by the Powers for peace is gaining 
ground. Turkey is willing and a movement on 
the part of the Allies is awaited. 

Hakki Pasha has informed Reuters that his 
mission to London is merely semi-official and he 
declared that the Turks wanted the territory of 
Thrace in order to make Constantinople, Mar- 
mora and the Dardanelles secure against Adria- 
nople. This was one of the points on which 
they insisted and in which they asked Europe to 
intervene, because peace resulting direct from 
negotiations with the belligerents was apparently 
out of the question. They insisted on retaining 
the Aegean Islands. 

Reuter’s agent at Constantinople reports that 

the cannonade continues at Adrianople. 

The Bulgarians advancing from Kadikeui were 
repulsed after two hours’ lighting, Simultaueous- 

March 3, 1913. 

THE GAZETTE 

ly the other forces of the Allies advanced and 
occupied the hills of Ilbassan but the Turkish 
volunteers recaptured them during a night 
attack. 

Reuter’s agent at Sofia reports that the Minis- 
try of Finance have issued a statement declaring 
that the payment of an indemnity is an essential 
condition to the conclusion of peace, but imme- 
diate payment will not be demanded. 

Mexican Revolution. The United States 
Government have intimated to President Huerta 
that they seriously object to the summary execu- 
tion of Senor Madero, the ex-Presidcnt. 

Reuter’s agent at Washington reports that four 
infantry regiments under Brigadier Smith have 
received orders to be ready to embark for Galves- 
ton. 

Reuter’s agent further reports that detachments 
of the Field Artillery, Engineers, the Hospital 
Ambulance and the Bakery have also been ordered 
to Galveston. This will bring the force up to 
3,500. It is expected a cavalry division will also 
be sent. 

It is stated that the execution of Senor Madero 
and his advisers without the process of the law 
will be regarded by the United States as a direct 
challenge. 

Ex President Castro has left New York for 

Cuba. 

Peking. Reuter’s agent reports that the 
Dowager Empress died on Saturday morning 
after a brief illness which was probably appendi- 
citis. 

During the last few days prior to her death she 
had occasional periods of acute illness. Rumours 
that she committed suicide spread, owing to the 
impending transfer of the Imperial Family to the 
Western Palace in order to make room for the 
Government at the Eastern Palace, but as the 
Dowager Empress herself suggested the transfer, 
this would seem to entirely disprove the suicide 
theory. 

The Suffragettes. Mrs. 1’ankhurst speak- 
ing at Chelsea reaffirmed that she would take the 
responsibility for the outrages and defied the 
Government. A representative of the Home 
Office took notes of her speech, which a disorder- 
ly audience interrupted. The newspapers have 
been discussing the problem of dealing with the 
“Militant nuisance” and suggest heavy lines in 
addition to imprisonment. It is stated the 
authorities have been informed of a plot to kid- 
nap the Cabinet Ministers. Special precautions 
are being taken to guard the Oxford boat at 
Putney, as there is just the chance of the suffra- 
gettes attacking it. Nearly a hundred private 
actions for damages for broken windows are 
pending against Mrs. Pankhurst and other mem- 
bers of the Militant Union. 

Mrs. Despard and other militants were howled 
down by the audience at a suffragette meeting 
held at Thornton Heath. The Police were com- 
pelled to dear the hall in order to protect the 
women from violence. 

London. Lord Knollys is about to retire from 

the Secretaryship to the King. 

Paris. The Legion of Honour has been con- 

ferred on the Aviatress Mademoiselle Dutrieu. 

At the trial of the motor bandits which is con- 
cluding, the Public Prosecutor demands the death 
sentence in six cases and twenty year’s penal 
servitude for the remainder.

2Ath February. 

The War. Reuter’s agent at Constantinople 
reports that the Turkish outlook has improved 
somewhat, thanks to the success of the 
Government in raising F50U,000 from the sale of 
certain properties in the neighbourhood of Cons- 
tantinople. This relief has enabled the Govern- 
ment to pay the outstanding months' salaries to 
all the officials and also the more pressing 
accounts with contractors. The military situation 
is also affected by the relief from pecuniary pres- 
sure, The question of supplies is not likely to 
cause any worry for some weeks. It is stated 
that the Government have altered their plan of 
campaign by abandoning the contemplated offen- 
sive flanking movement and are confident of 
their ability to hold out indefinitely at Chatalja 
and Bulair. 

Reuter learns that Vienna and St. Petersburg 
are now negotiating with regard to the boundaries 
of Albania. It is hoped that the Austro-Russian 
determination will avoid hostilities and result in 
some form of compromise. 

In replying to Turkey’s last demarche asking 
the Powers to intervene, the Powers have inti- 
mated their acceptance. Their collective Note 
has not yet been received. 

Ruumauia has accepted the Powers’ mediation 
and the Bulgarian acceptance is practically 
assured. 

Mexican Revolution. Reuter’s agent at New 
York reports that a telegram from Mexico City 
states that Senor Madero and his companions 
were shot and killed while being transferred in a 
motor ear from the National Palace to the 
penitentiary. Two of the attacking party were 
also killed. 

Reuter’s agent reports that Mr. Taft on receiv- 
ing the news about Senor Madero expressed his 
regret, bat intimated that the United States saw 
no cause for intervention. 

Reuter’s agent at Mexico_ City reports that the 
circumstances of the shooting of Senor Madero 
are obscure and even official accounts are con- 
flicting and the majority of the public are scepti- 
cal. Official versions prove that on Senor 
Madero s body there was only one wound in the 
back of the head. 

The Navy Estimates. Daily Telegraph 
states that the Navy Estimates provide for five 
Dreadnoughts excluding the one from the Malay 
States. 

workers nave threatened to strike owing to the 
dismissal of a Railway Guard named Richardson 
for disobeying the fireman’s orders. Richardson’s 
story is that the orders were contrary to the 
regulations. When he appealed to the Chairman 
the latter declared that he should have obeyed 
orders as the foreman was responsible to the 
officials. The National Union of Railwaymen 
ate negotiating with the Board of Trade. 

Mr. Bellamy, President of the new Raihvay- 
men’s Union, speaking at Worcester said that‘if 
Richardson, who objected to the break power of 
his train, had gone on, be might have been 
arraigned for manslaughter. 

The Earthquake. Reuter’s agent at Welling- 
ton reports that there have been severe earth- 
quake shocks at Westport. It was fortunate 
that none of the mines were injured. A consider- 
able amount of property was damaged, but there 
ffiiYe been no deaths, ' 

THE GAZETTE March 3, 1913 

26th February. 

The Wak. Eulgaria has accepted mediation 
in connection with the Bournano-Bulgarian diffi- 
culty. 

Beuter’s agent at Sofia reports that there is 
heavy snow everywhere at the front which will 
prevent military operations for. some days. 

Suffragettes. Mrs. Pankhurst has been ar- 
rested and charged at Epsom for inciting 
to blow up Mr. Lloyd George’s house. On enter- 
ing the Court she was greeted with cheers and 
boos. She was let out on bail for T700 on pro- 
mising to refrain from incitement or to attend 
public meetings. 

At a great suffragist meeting held in London 
Pavilion, the announcement of the arrest of Mrs. 
Pankhurst led to uproarious scenes which were 
due to the strong hostile element present. 

Mr. John Burns speaking at Battersea in refer- 
ring to the Suffragettes said he was going to do 
his best to break down the tyranny organised by 
blackguardism and it was to the interest of de- 
mocracy to terminate this despotism immedia- 
tely. 

Airships. Persistent reports from reliable wit- 
nesses state that there have been mysterious air- 
ships cruising from the North Sea every night 
over the^North and South of England. It trans- 
pires'that these coincide evith the official announ- 
cement of two long distance flights made by 
Zeppelin including the wonderful voyage of 10GD 
miles in thirty one hours. Great prominence is 
given to Germany’s air fleet of thirty six dirigibles 
twenty of which are capable of crossing and re- 
orossing|the North Sea without renewing the fuel. 
The German papers ridicule and resent the 
reports made by the English newspapers and 
declare that it is impossible even with a most 
powerful Zeppelin to secretly visit England Avith- 
out discovery. 

It is stated that at a meeting of the Committee 
of Imperial Defence presided over by Mr. Asquith 
the Committee started a new enquiry on the 
problem of invasion in vieAV of the changed 
conditions since the last enquiries. The present 
experts are Prince Louis of Battenberg and 
General Trench. The Morning Post says the 
Aerial Act Avill be enforced most strictly and it 
will be found that the prohibited areas are nume- 
rous. The officers have been fully empoAvered 
to deal Avith the matter and visitors to the Inter- 
national Aviation Competitions in England Avill 
in future be given no latitude respecting such 
areas. The question of private aerodromes in 
Britain will be thoroughly investigated. 

London. Mr. Samuel in a letter to the Marconi 
Company in reply to their letter of the 21st inst. 
reiterates that in his opinion the Company has 
no right to retire from the contract and that he 
will hold himself free to enforce his rights. 

H. M. the King has granted Mrs. Scott the same 
rank of precedence as if her husband had been 
nominated Commander of the Bath as he would 
have been if he had survived. 

Mrs. Scott has cabled her brother at Birmin- 
gham that she has heard of her husband’s death 
and that her health is good. 

Mawson Antarctic Expedition. Beuter’s 
agent at Sydney reports that Lieut. Ninnin and 
Doctor Mertz of the Mawson Antarctic Expedi- 
tion are dead. Mawson and six others have 
missed the relief ship and will be compelled to 
stay another winter in the Antarctic, 

Beuter’s agent at Melbourne reports that 
Lord Denman has received a Avireless message 
from Mawson via Macquarie Island announcing 
the tAvo deaths and stating that the others are 
Avell. 

Beuter’s agent further reports that Mawson 
himself sent a wireless message to the Governor- 
General stating that be had opened up a large 
area of new land near to CommouAvealth Bay and 
that be had obtained important data of the 
number of stations and their proximity to the 
magnetic pole. He concluded by stating that 
probably six of his staff and himself would 
unavoidably be detained for another year. 

Mawson also sent a message to the King in 
which he asks His Majesty’s permission to name 
the large area of newly discovered land King 
George the Fifth landThe area in question 
lies between Victoria-land and Adelie-land where 
the expedition’s main sleighing efforts are con- 
centrated. 

Lisbon. Beuter’s agent reports that in the 
Chamber, the Foreign Minister denied the ru- 
mours relating to the Anglo-German negotiations 
on the subject of Portugal and said the British 
Government had no intention of concluding any 
agreement Avhich might affect the sovereignty 
and integrity of Portugal and her Colonies, and 
no such agreement existed betAvecn Great Britain 
and Germany and no negotiations had therefore 
been opened by the German Government. He 
repudiated the suggestion that Germany ever 
thought of interfering with Portugal’s sovereign 
rights. 

Mexican Bevolution. Beuter’s agent reports 
that 95 Mexican Federal Volunteers revolted 
protesting against the killing of Scnor Madero. 
They Avere taken out one by one and shot against 
a wall.

The War. Beports from Vienna indicate 
that it has been provisionally settled that 
Skutari is to be included in the ucav Albania 
hut Austria is making in return concessions to 
Montenegro and Servia in other directions, 
though important points still remain to he 
settled. 

Bussia’s concession Avith regard to Skutari is 
likely to ensure an early solution to Austro- 
Bussian differences. 

Mexican Bevolution. Bcuter’s agent reports 
that President Huerta has ordered the Portraits 
of ex-President Diaz to he restored to the 
Public Buildings. 

Airships. A considerable sensation was caus- 
ed at Portsmouth on Monday night by an airship 
with a poAverful light which was hovering about 
in the vicinity of the Marine Barracks. She 
departed towards the North. The police and 
others heard the machinery and Avatched the 
manoeuvring searchlight. A similar incident 
occurred at Hull on Tuesday night. 

The German papers point out that d Zeppelins 
are now at Johannistal, Potsdam, Frankfurt and 
Baden and that it would be impossible for them 
to reach the Yorkshire coast at the time alleged 
in England without a long daylight flight through 
Germany and Holland, where they would have

The French President. The Tsar in send- 
ing M. Poincare the Insignia of St. Andrew Avroto 
a long letter in which he emphasized that the 
Franco-Bussian Alliance was the basis of the 
Bussian Foreign Policy and that a constant 
collaboration of Cabinets in Paris and St. Peters- 
burg is indispensable. 

The French papers in referring to the exchange 
of friendly letters between the Tsar and M. 
Poincare on Tuesday declare that it was a great 
day in the annals of the Alliance and this splen- 
did demonstration coming at the moment Avhen 
France is exposed to the threat of Germany’s 
armaments, makes it especially impressive. 

Paris. Beuter’s agent reports that the Minis- 
ters of War and Finance have announced the 
introduction of (he Bill providing 500,000,000 
francs to accelerate the execution of certain 
military Avorks.

The King of Denmark in replying said he hoped 
the Dano-German relations would deA7elop on a 
firm basis of mutual trust hetAveen the two kind-

to Skutari. 

Eeuter’s agent at Vienna states that circum- 
stantial reports which say that Russia and Aus- 
tria are ready to demobilise are semi-officially 
described as premature. The IIeincr Allgemcine 
Zcitung on Thursday evening said demobilisation 
is probable but in nowise certain, as the situation 
is virtually unchanged. 

Beuter’s agent reports that it is admitted that 
Hakki Pasha’s mission to London is a failure 
owing to the PoAvers refusing to accept the 
Porte’s reply to their Note.

The War. Keuter’s agent at Constantinople 
reports that the Police have discovered a cons- 
piracy against the Government. It is alleged to 
have been organised by Lutli Bey, the Secretary 
to Prince Sabacddin, and nine others including 
four officers. Several of them have been arrested 
and the others are in hiding. There is no evi- 
dence that Prince Sabacddin was connected with 
the plot. 

Eeuter’s agent at Sofia reports that Eussia has 
informed Bulgaria that the Porte is disposed to 
negotiate for peace with Bulgaria on the basis oi: 
the surrender of Adrianople. 

Eeuter’s agent at Constantinople reports that 
the situation at Bulair and Chatalja is unchanged. 
The bombardment of Adrianople continues but 
less vigorously. 

Eeuter’s agent at Vienna reports that the 
Textile Manufacturers’ organisations have sent a 
petition to Parliament protesting at the idea of 
a war especially against Servia and complaining 
of the injury that would be done to their trade 
resulting from the detention of the Beservists 
on the frontier. 

Paris. Eeuter’s agent reports that the Go- 
vernment has submitted to the Chamber a Bill 
providing for 1:20,000,000 to provide for Avar 
material which is most urgent and necessary to 
bring the Army to a proper pitch of efficiency 
within a maximum of five years. The preamble 
declared that recent wars confi Lined the necessity 
that nations should constantly be maintaining 
their defence on a level with the progress of 
military science and art, otherwise they would 
drift into a condition of inferiority which would 
be difficult to remedy afterwards and emphasized 
that it would not involve any additional burden. 
The Admiralty have decided to enter a limited 
number of Boyal Naval Beserve Officers of the 
Mercantile Marine between the ages of 22 and 
32 on the Supplementary List of the Eoyal Navy. 
The National Defence Association in a memo- 
rial to Mr. Asquith urges the Government to 
take the nation into its confidence and give 
a plain statement of the position of the country 
in view of the changed circumstances of recent 
years and urges the necessity of a national 
military education. 

Mr. Grahame-White has submitted to the 
Government a, scheme for the establishment of a 
mercantile air fleet to be subsidised by the Gov- 
ernment with airship stations dotted on the coast 
and the establishment of schools and air pilots. 

The Honourable Mr. Justice Parker suc- 

ceeds Lord Macnuughten,

chiefly amongst the workmen and students in 
connection with the forthcoming tercentenary of 
the Eomanoff dynasty.

Mr. J. IT. Sinclair, H.B.M. Acting Agent 
and Consul-General, and Captain Barton, the 
First Minister, who were accompanied by 
several of the Government Officials, paid a 
visit of inspection to Pemba on Saturday last, 
and returned to Zanzibar early this morning. 

Mrs. Edward Clarke left Zanzibar for 
England by the s. s. “Prinzregent” on Tues- 
day last. 

 :o:  

Captain and Mrs. Durand sailed for 
Europe via The Cape by the s. s. “Caris- 
brook Castle’ on the 25th ultimo. 

Mr. and Mrs. Withycomjje, Mr. S. !’• 
Bland and Dr. & Mrs. Hoivard were pas- 
sengers from Pemba by H. H. S. “Cupid” on 
Friday last. 

Mr. E. W. P. Thurstan returned from Nai- 

robi per s. s. “Priuzessin ’ this morning. 

The peculiar atmospheric depression which 
has existed in Zanzibar during the past 
week, culminated in a heavy squall which 
almost atained the force of a gale last 
evening. The storm which had been preced- 
ed by vivid lightning and thunder broke 
at 9-15 p. m. and continued for about an 
hour. 

A considerable number of shore boats, 
anchored off Shangaiii, were either sunk or 
driven ashore and a number of native huts 
had their roofs blown off. 

A disastrous fire occurred in the native 

quarter on Monday last. 

At about 2 p, m, flames were discovered 
issuing from a house in the Zizi la Ngombe 

March 3, 1913.

quarter which had been left locked by the 
occupants, and owing to the high wind which 
prevailed at the time the fire spread with al- 
arming rapidity through Mtendeni. Membe- 
ta.nga,Membweui,up to the Yikokotouidistrict. 
Unfortunately the tide was low and altliough 
the fire engine was quickly on the spot the 
tire was beyond the range of the hose and 
the only means of keeping the conflagration 
within limits was by unroofing all thatched 
houses within the threatened area. The police 
who were assisted by some hundreds of 
voluntary helpers, did all that was possible 
to check the spread of the flames but when 
the tide had risen sufficiently to permit of 
the effective use of the fire engine, many 
houses in the Vikokotoni district were burn- 
ing. 

This was the first occasion on which the 
new motor engine had been used and when 
once within range its effectiveness was quick- 
ly apparent and by 5 o’clock the outbreak 
was well under control. 

The number of huts actually burnt is 
returned at .148, but if those unroofed and 
damaged by water are also taken into 
account, the loss to the native population 
is considerable. The cause of the outbreak 
is unknown, but in the light of subsequent 
outbreaks later in the week there would 
appear to be good reason for the theory that 
it is the work of an incendiary. A similar 
outbreak occurred within this area in Octo- 
ber last. 

On Thursday two fires occurred one at 
Kisimajongo at 1.30 o’clock and another later 
at Kibokoni which resulted in the destruction 
of 26 houses. Owing- to the low tide in the 
creek the lire engine was once more ineffec- 
tive, 

 :o:  

On Friday again the police were called to 
another outbreak at Vikokotoni at 2 p. m. 
On this occasion some six houses were burnt 
down in close proximity to the scene of Mon- 
day’s conflagration.

ZANZIBAR SAILING CLUB. 

The third and last race for the cup pre- 
sented by the Zanzibar Government was 
sailed over the usual course to the South of 
Shangaiii Point on Saturday. 1st instant. 

Four boats entered, and when the starting 
gun was fired tit 3 p. m. there was hardly any 
wind, and the start was in consequence a 
very poor one. 

The run to the first buoy moored off 
Kiungani beacon occupied nearly an hour 
the boats at times being becalmed, but 
at about 4 o’clock a breeze sprang up from the 
North and enabled all the boats to com- 
plete the first round soon after 4-30. 

The breeze however soon lost streng 

and the second round took, about an hour, 
Lulu crossing the line at 5-38-30, and win- 
ning on her time allowance. 

Lulu, having been placed second in each 
of the previous races, secured the greatest 
number of marks, and her owners Messrs. 
Clarke and Lofting are to be congratulated 
on her success in winning the cup. 

The Captain and Officers of the C. S. 
‘Sherard Osborn” very kindly placed their 
ship at the disposal of the Club, and Mr. 
Saw of the same ship very kindly acted as 
Officer of the day.
