the gloom of tho week accentuated by 
the roar of the guns of the squadron at 
practice culminated this morning in a 
violent burst ot rain from the SOUTHWEST 
in fact what with the thunder of cannon 
and the crash of heavens batteries 
frighted folk would have had little difficulty this 
morning in imagining themselves in a 
besieged city ever a fruitful topic of 
DISCUSSION weather in zanzibar provides us 
with many surprises not always delightful 
SINCE the turn of the year we have been 
asking one anotherwhy all this rain now 
when is the NORTHEAST monsoon going to 
blow unanswered these questions will 
soon give way to the more serious one 
of the MARIKA which we may expect within 
a few weeks 

after enjoying the luxury of fresh butter 
for A weeks zanzibar has been compelled 
to return again to her tins this is due 
we understand to representations that the 
govern incut farm at naivasha was 
engaging in unfair competition with the 
settlers of nairobi while we entirely 
concur in the principal here involved we 
venture to point out that in sending fresh 
butter to zanzibar the government were 
not competing with the settlers the 
settlers cannot supply us and from what 
we can learn there is no prospect of their 
doing so yet 

whether the market of zanzibar is worth 
securing with the aid of government 
produce or without it is a question that 
concerns nairobi but as we cannot get fresh 
butter from nairobi we see no reason why 
w e should not endeavour to obtain it from 
jhirban we are served with two lines of 
mail steamers equipped with refrigerators 

the gazette 
YOU lbs a mouth COULD supply our needs at 
present but the market if properly supplied 
would we feel sure prove to be a rapidly 
expanding one 

cloves which promised great things at 
the end of the week have somewhat 
deteriorated again and have disappointed 
their supporters but like shellac cloves 
are full ot possibilities and another surprise 
may he sprung upon us at any moment 
its movements are watched with intense 
interest by all engaged in the article 
chilliesan enquiry for zanzibar 
growth has sprung up and sales to a good 
extent have been made at IS id up to 
WAS per cwt closing at the latter for fair 
quality which exhibits an advance

gruesome the chief of the place 
was a big rebel leader and we met him
