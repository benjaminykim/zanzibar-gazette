I at once sent a message to the two chiefs to send 
food into the camp the following morning, and that if 
it did not make its appearance I should have to come 
and take it from them, as it was not a fitting time 
to stand on ceremony with these rascals, who are a 
precisely similar lot to those inhabiting the Bura 
Mountains, who were recently punished by the 
company for their treacherous behaviour. An an- 
swer was sent bade to say that the food should be 
sent in. The following morning, after waiting till 
nearly 12 o’clock without seeing any signs of food 
coming in, I despatched a party of 25 men with 
rifles, with orders to bring the two chiefs into camp. 
I f attacked they were to lire on the people, but only 
in self-defence. My men effected the capture, and 
sd50 brought in a third old vallain, who had tried to 
egg the people on to fight, which he nearly succeed- 
ed in doing. 

Samboja and Mkamba were in a great fright 
and wished to make blood-brotherhood with me at 
once. The third old man was inolent and defiant, 
so promptly put k.m in chains so as to give him 
time to cool down. I explained to the two chiefs 
that 1 must have food, but, at the same time, did 
not. wish to obtain it by violence unless compelled 
to do so. They replied that if I would make blood- 
brotherhood with them plenty should he brought in. 
Wishing to give them every chance, I consented, 
and the ceremony was performed, after which I 
allowed then to return to their villages. 
.As Miinyinigi, the third indiyidual, was still 
breathing defiance. I kept him in chains for the 
night in camp, and threatened that if lie continued 
to hold the same tone, 1 would take him away 
altogether and send him down to the coast.

DEATH OF 

H. H. SAYYID All BIN SAID 

AND PROCLAMATION OF 

SAYYID HAMED BIN THWAIN 

AS 

SULTAN OF ZANZIBAR. 

Wo have to record with much regret the 
death of His Highness SayyidAli bin Said, 
who, after a long and tedious illness, passed 
away at 8 o’clock on Sunday evening last, the 
5th inst., at the palace in Zanzibar. This event 
was not unexpected, as it had been known for 
months past that the late Sultan had been in 
a precarious state of health, though it was not 
easy to know the precise course of his illness, 
as lie refused to receive the attentions of any 
European doctor, and to the last made strong 
efforts to conceal how dangerously ill he real- 
ly was, though he had some few days ago an- 
ticipated a fatal ending at no distant date and 
; apprised Mr. Rennell Rodd, Her Majesty’s 
' Diplomatic Agent, of his apprehensions. 
During the last few weeks rumours of the 
Sultan’s death had been cm-rent in the Bazaar 
and bad caused at times considerable excite- 
ment until tbeir falsity had been established. 
In view of the possibility of disturbances oc- 
curring when the Sultan’s death did take 
place, the British authorities, both at the 
| Consulate and in the Navy, had prepared for 
any emergency : a signalman had been on 
duty for the past three weeks at the Agency, 
; lauding parties had been arranged and regu- 
I larly drilled on board H. M. S. “ Philomel,” 
while the night guard of Iskaris had been 
1 strengthened, especially in districts where 
I trouble was likely to ensue, and only last Fri- 
’ day General Hatch, in the presence of Sir. 
Keimell Rodd, had shown the really danger- 
| pus element at Melindi bow quickly the 
troops could be formed in their square if any 
;; disturbances arose in that quarter. 
The last month must have been an extreme- 
ly anxious one for all responsible for the se- 
curity of the town, as fears were entertained 
in many quarters that the death of the Sultan 
would he the signal for an outbreak of riot- 
ins, if not worse, throughout the town, though 
these apprehensions were considerably lessen- 

ed when it became evident that the British 
authorities had prepared for every emergency 
and had taken precautions against every risk. 
The cause for such fears was to be found in the 
fact that, in addition to the ordinary dangers 
attending a time of great and general excite- 
ment in a mixed and only partially civilized 
community like Zanzibar, there were no less 
than three claimants to the throne, each of 
whom had a considerable number of armed 
adherents: thus it was almost certain that the 
proclamation of a successor would lead to dis- 
sensions amongst the Arabs, and in such an 
event, the latter would probably be inclined 
to resort to force on behalf of their parti- 
sans and in any case,revenge themselves, even 
temporarily, upon the authorities in view of 
the injuries inflicted upon their own personal 
interests by the adoption and enforcement of 
a European policy in which slave-raiding- and 
slavery was being abolished, and restrictions 
placed upon an unlimited appropriation of 
revenue by those Arabs who happened to be 
in favour at the Palace. 
The news of Sayyid Ali’s death was received 
with considerable doubt in town for a few 
minutes, in view of previous false rumours, 
but its truth on this occasion was soon appa- 
rent to everyone. Within ten minutes of bis 
death having been signalled to H. M. S. 
“ Philomel” a naval party, numbering about 
160 men and armed with machine guns, were 
landed (at 9-10 p.m.) from that ship and H.M. 
S.“Blanche,” under the charge of Lieut. A. B. 
G. Grenfell, whilst a party of marines were 
landed at the Consulate to form a guard for 
Mr. Rennell Rodd, H. M. Diplomatic Agent, 
who, accompanied by Captain Campbell, Se- 
nior Naval Officer, proceeded with this escort 
towards the Palace : the Blue-jackets joined 
this party at the Custom House and marched 
thence to the Palace, where they foiuid Gene- 
ral Mathews, First Minister of the Govern- 
ment, to whose coolness and presence of mind 
must be attributed the fact, that the Arabs in 
the vicinity of the Palace had not already re- 
sorted to violence to force an entry. Ad- 
mittance was demanded and at first re- 
fused, and it was reported that an arm- 
ed force of Arabs bad been seen approach- 
ing- the Palace but bad turned back 
when they saw the naval force being- lauded 
on the beaeli : for a brief interval matters 
looked serious, and the Persian guard being 
in possession of a loaded machine gun and 
occupying one corner of the Palace square ap- 
peared to be also an clement of danger,though 
this was shortly removed by tbeir placing 
themselves under the orders of General 

Mathews. The Palace was at this time 
occupied by Said bin Khalid, who had 
taken forcible possession: Captain Camp- 
bell, who bad been desired by Mr. Rodd to 
take military charge of afiairs, then brought 
up a gun to the Palace door to effect 
an entry by force if necessary, but, Said 
bin Khalid thought it wisest not to prolong 
the opposition and opened the doors. A 
search was then instituted and Captain Camp- 
bell proceeded to the upper storey of the Pa- 
lace, followed by Mr. Rodd and a guard of 
marines, the Brigade being left in charge of 
the Square under the command of Lieut. 
Grenfell. Said bin Khalid was at once made 
prisoner and sent under a guard to his own 
house where he was kept a close prisoner. 
The prompt action _of the authorities in. 
taking charge ef the Palace prevented the 
Treasur" Room being- broken into and robbed: 
and in fact there does not appear to have been 
any looting either in the Palace or about the 
town. 
Sayyid Hamed bin Thwain bin Sultan bin 
Emuum, the Sultan Designate who had 
remained quietly in his own house, 
unconscious of the honour in store for him, 
was then sent for, and a. Conference 
was held in the Palace, Mr. Rodd, H. M. Di- 
plomatic Agent, Captain Campbell, Senior 
Naval Officer, General Lloyd Mathews, 
Captain Lindley of H. M. S. “ Blanche,” 
General Hatch, and several leading- Arabs 
being present, marines being- posted at 
the door. Sayyid Hamed bin Thwain having 
accepted the proposals made to him by Mr. 
Rodd, be was declared Sultan, and the Pro- 
clamation publicly read at 11 r.vr. from the 
steps of the Palace, the Naval Brigade 
presenting arms, and the buglers sounding- 
a royal salute. The naval brigade was 
then divided into two parties, one remaining- 
on shore for service and the other returning to 
their ships: the party remaining on shore 
was relieved early on Monday morning. 
On the news becoming known in town, 
there was a general closing and barring of 
houses and shops; parties of native troops and 
military police with fixed bayonets patrol- 
led the main streets, giving orders for doors 
to be closed, while at v'arious points aboul the 
town and suburbs there was a well-timed dis- 
play of native troops and military police also 
with fixed bayonets. The news was received 
quietly and after the first excited hum of en- 
quiring voices had died away, the only sound 
to be heard was the loud wailing- from the 
late Sultan’s harem, where the nows had been 
conveyed to his wives, varied at intervals bv

;i re-assiiring biigle call from one nr other of |1 
tin- recently constructed guard houses at:1 
Melindi, Ngamhu, &c., at all of which a strong ; 
force had been stationed. The streets were 
patrolled during the night by arnred police, 
General Hatch making personal visits to all ] 
the dangerous ]X)ints. The task of maintain- 
ing order about the town was most capitally 1 
carried out by General Hatch who, despite 
the fact that the Tskaris had to he summoned 
to the various districts by bugle had guards 
placed within a very few minutes at even the ! 
most distant points. 
The body of the late Sultan, after being ex- 
amined by the Consular Surgeon, D_r. F. 
Oharlesworth, and cause of death ascertained, 
was interred under a date palm in the. Palace 
garden at 1 a.m. 
On Monday morning the town had a very 
deserted aspect; all shops and native houses , 
being closed, with very few inhabitants about 
the streets. A small crowd had gathered in 
front of the Palace which had been guarded 
all night by the naval forces: General Mat- 
hews and General Hatch were both at the 
Palace, the former having spent the night 
there. 
At about 10 a.m. Mr. Pennell Kodd, ac- 
companied by Captain Campbell, General 
Mathews, the Consular and Government 
staffs, Captain Lindley and several of the 
Officers ofH.M.S. “Philomel” and “Blanche” 
proceeded to the Palace where they were re- 
ceived at a Tiaruza by the recently proclaimed 
•Sultan, most of the leading Arabs also being 
present : during this interviewtho flag of His 
Highness was hoisted and saluted by the Eng- 
lish and French Men-of-War in harbour and 
by the Zanzibar Mau-of-War “ Glasgow,” all 
of which were decorated with flags and bunt- 
ing. "With the departure of Mr.Rodd and 
his Staff from the Palace the public events of 
the day terminated, hut the streets were con- 
tinually patrolled and a strong force of native 
troojts kept on guard at the Palace. 

On Tuesday morning a reconciliation was 
effected between Sayid bin Khalid and the 
•Sultan the former being restored to his posi- i 
tion of honour in the Court and granted 
presents by the Sultan. The only dissentient 
remaining' now is the third aspirant to the 
throne, Suyyid Hamoud, who is also a cousin 
of the late Sultan; he is an older man than 
Sayyid Haiued bin Thwain and bad hopes of 
being made Sultan ; up to the present Sayyid 
Tliunoud has not presented himself at the 
Court of the new Sultan, though it is very 
unlikely that he will take any active steps in 
opposition to his rule. 
In the course of yesterday morning the 
Sultan received visits from the representa- 
tives of the several Foreign Powers, who 
were introduced to him by Mr. Pennell 
Podd ; salutes were fired from the Mcn-of- 
War as the respective Consuls left the Palace. 
Congratulations are general with regard 
to the admirable way in which the an- 
ticipated dangers attending the important 
change which has just taken place had 
been obviated and the complete absence of 
rioting or lawlessness in any form proved 
how perfect had been the arrangements : a 
brief delay in taking charge of the Palace, or 
a want of organization in the naval, military, 
or police arrangements would have inevitably 
resulted in confusion and danger,the elements 

of which were by no means absent as bad the 
claimants to the throne met with their armed 
adherents bloodshed would have inevita- 
bly resulted. Were it not for the Pro- 
tecterate cxtonclod. by otiv 'ivor 
this island, and for the security which 
has been established by those respon- 
sible for affairs, we should in all probability at 
the present moment find trade paralysed, and 
the town a scene of riot and confusion while 
the aspirants to the throne were engaged in 
settling their claims by force. 
The reign which has just closed has seen 
many and great changes in the territorial pos- 
sessions of the Sultanate of Zanzibar : at the 
commencement of Sayyid AH’s reign these 
comprised not only the Islands of Zanzibar 
and Pemba, hut. the whole Coastline from 
Mgau to Benader: a portion of this was 
leased at an annual rental to the Imperial 
' British East Africa Co. but the remainder 
was under the direct control of the Sultan of 
Zanzibar. Difficulties assailed Sayyid Ali, 
however at the very outset, as promises had 
been given by his predecessor which entitled 
Gomany to a claim over the Mgau Coast and 
the territory behind. These were at first 
resisted by the Sultan, but afterwards agreed 
to, a sum of £200,000 being paid as purchase 
money for this territory. At this juncture 
Sayyid Ali applied to England for protection 
which was granted, and his seat upon the 
throne, which was not particularly secure at 
that time, was assured to him. The relief 
which this protection afforded to Sayyid Ali 
was however only temporary, as he found 
that it necessitated the abolishment of abuses 
dear to the Arab nature: he was called upon 
to use his influence in repressing the slave 
trade and had consequently to issue edicts 
which provoked the enmity of his leading 
Arab subjects. Whatever his own ideas may 
have been with regard to the advantages of 
European civilisation, the policy he had to 
I pursue, as the cost of seeming the j^roteetioii 
of a European Power, was highly distasteful 
to his fellow countrymen, who did not conceal 
from their Sultan their opposition to his edicts, 
and appeared at times, regardless of the rash- 
ness and uselessness of such a proceeding, to 
have blamed the Sultan for not openly resisting 
the progress of European civilisation in his 
dominions whenever it clashed with their 
personal interests. The close of Sayyid Ali’s 
brief reign can therefore have been scarcely 
happier for his own personal comfort than 
its commencement. As step after step was 
taken to protect, not the interests of the 
Sultan and the chief Arabs personally, (as 
they might have anticipated at first), but the 
interests of Zanzibar and its people, Sayyid 
Ali must have found himself in a most 
trving position : on the one hand he had to 
assist in carrying out a policy which could 
pay little heed to Arab ideas, and on the other 
band, be bad to meet daily in bis Court the 
leading Arabs whose interests were being 
affected by this policy and endeavour to 

8th March 189:} 
stem the wave of enmity which each fresh 
step raised amongst these subjects. 

Without question Zanzibar is better in 
every way at the close of Sayyid Ali’s reign 
compared with its state when he ascended the 
throne, but it has been improved of necessity 
according to European ideas and not to the 
immediate personal advantage either of its 
Arab sovereign nor his Arab subjects. 

Sayyid Ali bin Said bin Sultan bin Emaum 
at the time of his death was only 38 years 
of age : he had been in weak health for the 
past two years, his death resulting primarily 
from general debility, though the immediate 
cause of death appears to have been a form of 
dropsy resulting from a complication of dis- 
eases of the liver and heart. He was a well 
built man of pleasing appearance and affable 
manners, and we have no doubt that those | 
who have known him best and appreciated the 
difficulties of his position will have felt deep 
sympathy with him in the long illness which 
closed in his death last Sunday evening. 

The new Sultan is about 40 years of age 
and in the enjoyment of excellent health. 
He has only one wife, a daughter of Sayyid 
Burgash, to whom he is greatly devot- 
ed ; his claim by descent to the throne was 
a very strong one while his personal character 
and ideas rendered him acceptable to the 
British authorities. It is to be hoped that 
guided by the advice of the Protecting Pow- 
er, Zanzibar will increase in influence and 
prosperity during the reign of H. H. Sayyid 
Hamed bin Thwain, of which there seems at 
present every hopeful augury. His public 
declarations have been extremely satisfactory; 
he has declared to his Arab subjects that he 
thoroughly understands his position and will 
do all in his power to maintain it: and that 
he is thoroughly at one with the Protecting 
Power. He has at once set to work to reform 
abuses and has shown every promise of being 
a strong and capable ruler. 

The general effect of the events which have 
just occurred has been to show the Arabs the i 
real meaning of a Protectorate which up to 
the present they had failed to understand. 
Now that any doubts on tins point have been 
cleared up, it seems very improbable that H. 
H. Sayyid Hamed bin Thwain will have to 
encounter the opposition and unpleasantness 
which was shown to his predecessor by many 
of his subjects. As the benefits of the Pro- 
tectorate become more and more manifest, as 
they are becoming day by day, there is little 
doubt but that the Arabs will see that what- 
ever is to the benefit of Zanzibar generally is 
alike beneficent to themselves, and the fric- 
tion which naturally attended the suppression 
of slave-trading having passed away, will join 
heartily in assisting the Protecting Power in 
its work of progress.

EAST AFRICAN NEWS. 

LOCAL NEWS. 

The M. M. s.s. “Pei-Ho” arrived on the 
2nd instant with European mails up to the 
10th ultimo : her passenger list comprised 
Bishop Smythies, Bishop Hornby (of Jfyassa- 
land), Messrs. J. S. Wimhush, A. Butler, H. 
M. Pearson, AV. Cowey, Malcolm C. Kerr, M. 
Hohmaim, Poueel, Beasley, Madame Hooper 
Alias A. E. Wyatt and Hr. Koch. She left for 
Aladagascar and Alauritius on the followins 
day. 

The M.H.P. s.s. “ Tnngue” arrived this 
morning with European mails up to the 17th 
ultimo. 

The Al. AI. s.s. “ Ava ” arrived from the 
south on Alonday and left yesterday with 
mails for Europe, her passenger list compri- 
sing Captain flardinge, II.A. and sister, Rev. 
Father Lutz, Dr. Koenig with wife and infant. 
As an act of grace the accession of Sayyid 
Hamed bin Thwain. to the throne has been 
marked by the release of prisoner's confined 
under the British jurisdiction: at present 
these only number two, which speaks favor- 
ably for the state of the place. 

Letters have arrived from Sir Gerald Portal 
from Kikuyu and also from Lake Kavasso, 

8th March 1893. 
the latter hearing date the 11th Feby: all the 
party were in good health except Dr. Aloffat 
who has been rather iE: after a three days’ 
halt at Kikuyu to gather provisions toge- 
ther the Commission started from there on 
the 5th Feb. for a 23 days’ march across a 
foodless tract of countiy : they found a rather 
hostile feeling prevailing in Kikuyu. 

Affairs at Kismayu are quiet: the stockade 
is almost finished, and there are 300 men gar- 
risoning the place in addition to the Com- 
pany’s Iskaris: the “Sparrow” has reheved 
the “ Widgeon” at this place. 

Captain Hardinge, R.A., late Port Officer, 
accompanied by his sister left yesterday for 
England per the s.s. “ Ava.” Captain Hard- 
inge doesnot intend to return to Zanzibar as he 
has found the climate trying to his health. 
He has the satisfaction however of having 
considerably improved the port during the 
time it has been under his control, and of hav- 
ing carried out one of the most valuable clau- 
ses (for mercantile and anti-slaving purposes 
in the Brussels Act), that of registering and 
numbering the hundreds of dhows which trade 
in those waters. The departure of Aliss 
Hardinge is also much regretted, this lady 
having made many friends in Zanzibar. 
Captain and Aliss Hardingc were bid farc- 
weU on board by nearly all the town residents 
and by members of H." AI. Navy at present in 
Zanzibar, including Air. Eennell Redd, 
H.AI. Diplomatic Agent, Captain Campbell, 
Senior Naval Officer, General Lloyd Alathews, 
First Alinister of the Government, Air. AV.B.

Bishop Smythies returned to Zanzibar per 
the s.s. “Pei-Ho” accompanied by Bishop 
Hornby and several other members of the Uni- 
versities’ Mission: Bishop Hornby preached the 
sermon in the Cathedral last Sunday after- 
noon. Bishop Smythies wiU probably cross 
to Alagiln very shortly and remain there 
untE after Easter, while Bishop Hornby will 
leave about the middle of next month for 
Nyassaland. 

On Sunday next, Alarch 12th, the Bishop 
of Zanzibar proposes to ordain a native Deacon 
at the Swahili celebration of Holy Communion. 
The service wiU begin at 7 a.m. 
The usual English Alorning service wiU 
not be held next Sunday. 
The afternoon service will be held at 4 
p. m. instead of at 4-45 p.m. as usual : when 
the Bishop will give an address to be foDowcd 
by a service of Benediction at the openino- 
of the new hospital. All European residents- 
are invited to he present. 

The final game in the Lawn Tennis Tour- 
nament which has been in progress durin"- 
the past fortnight was played last Thursday 
afternoon, when nearly all the town residents 
were present : the final was between 
Cave and Pordage against Richardson and 
DeSausmarez, the latter winning after a hard 
fought game : a full account of the various 
games played in the course ofjthis Tournament

Nzai, Ulu, Dec. 8. 

J reopen this report to add that, the mail men not 
having come into Kibwesi as expected, T brought 
my letters along with me. I arrived at the first 
camp, about an hour’s march from this yesterday, 
and then learnt that the company’s agent at Ma- 
chakos hiis heen lighting with (ho AVa-Kamba 
at Xvilungu, immediately ahead of us, about their 
refusal to supply food to passing caravans. He 
had written a general letter, which was brought me 
by an old chief at Nani, who has charge of it, to 
say that everything was now settled and things 
were on a satisfactory footing once more. How- 
ever, shortly after leaving camp, this morning, I 
met the mail men on the road, and they tell me 
that the people who were actually fought with have 
not made peace, and wanted to attack them on the 
way. xliey made a jiigin. inarch, and escaped outj 
of their clutches. It appears that only the people 
living close to the station (who were not fought 
with) have made peace with the company’s agent. 
I have had in consequence to piteli camp again 
ill order to get the food which T hoped to procure 
on my arrival at Kilnngu to-day, but this is now 
out of the question, and wo may have to do some 
fighting to-morrow. The road from here lies up 
the bed of the river Tivu. which is now some six or 
eight inches deep in water, with high banks on each 
side. The walking is had, as the bed of the river 
is full of quicksands, so if the natives are inclined 
to he hostile they have distinctly the advantage of 
the position, as a laden caravan can travel hut 
slowly under such circumstances, i therefore am 
not looking forward to to-morrow with any great 
degree of pleasure. They may, perhaps, decline to 
interfere with us when they sec the riHes, provided 
that the men keep well together. Stragglers will 
have a very poor time of it. It is fortunate 1 met 
the mail men when I did : otherwise, on the strength 
of what the letter at Nzai contained, 1 should have 
walked gaily into it all and might have had most 
serious trouble. As it is, 1 am now propared for 
whatever may happen : but all this kind of thing 
is most troublesome and annoying, ns it has delayed 
me for another day. The saying “It never rains 
hut it pours ” have come true enough in my case. 
I wish the company would wake up and arrange 
matters properly, once and for all, along the 
whole route, instead of dealing with them in this 
desultory fashion.— The Times

Zanzibar, 8th March, 1893. 

DEATH OF 

H. H. SAYYID All BIN SAID 

AND PROCLAMATION OE 

SAYYID HAMED BIN THWAIN 

AS 

SULTAN OE ZANZIBAR. 

We have to record with much regret the 
death of His Highness Sayyid Ali hin Said, 
who, after a long and tedious illness, passed 
away at 8 o’clock on Sunday evening last, the 
0th inst., at the palace in Zanzibar. This event 
was not unexpected, as it had been known for 
months past that the late Sultan had been in 
a precarious state of health, though it was not 
easy to know the precise course of his illness, 
as he refused to receive the attentions of any 
European doctor, and to the last made strong 
efforts to conceal how dangerously ill ho real- 
ly was, though he had some few days ago an- 
ticipated a fatal ending at no distant date and 
apprised Mr. Rennell Rodd, Her Majesty’s 
Diplomatic Agent, of his apprehensions. 
During the last few weeks rumours of the 
Sultan’s deatli had heen current in the Bazaar 
and had caused at times considerable excite- 
ment until their falsity had been established. 
In view of the possibility of disturbances oc 
curling when the Sultan’s death did take 
place, the British authorities, both at the 
Consulate and in the Navy, had prepared for 
any emergency : a signalman had been on 
duty for the past three weeks at the Agency, 
landing parties had heen arranged and regu- 
larly drilled on hoard H. M. S. “Philomel,’ 
while the night guard of Iskaris had been 
strengthened, especially in districts where 
trouble was likely to ensue, and only last Fri- 
day General Hatch, in the presence of Mr. 
Rennell Rodd, had shown the really danger 
ous element at Melindi how quickly the 
troops could be formed in their square if any 
disturbances arose in that quarter. 
The last month must have heen an extreme- 
ly anxious one for all responsible for the se- 
curity of the town, as fears were entertained 
in many quarters that the death of the Sultan 
would he the signal for an outbreak of riot- 
ing. if not worse, throughout the town, though 
these apprehensions were considerably lessen- 

led when it became evident that the British 1 Mathews. The Palace 
I authorities had prepared for every emergency occupied by Said bin 
I and had taken precautions against every risk. 
| The cause for such fears was to he found in the 
fact that, in addition to the ordinary dangers 
attending a time of great and general excite 
ment in a mixed and only partially civilized 
community like Zanzibar, there were no loss 
than three claimants to the throne, each of 
whom had a considerable number of armed 
adherents: thus it was almost certain that the 
proclamation of a successor would load to dis- 
sensions amongst the Arabs, and in such an 
event, the latter would probably ho inclined 
to resort to force on behalf of their parti- 
sans and ill any case,revenge themselves, oven 
temporarily, upon the authorities in view of 
the injuries inflicted upon their own personal 
interests by the adoption and enforcement of 
a European policy in which slave-raiding and 
shivery was being abolished, and restrictions 
placed upon an unlimited appropriation of 
revenue by those Arabs who happened to bo 
in favour at the Palace. 
The news of Sayyid Ali’s death was received 
with considerable doubt in town for a few 
minutes, in view of previous false rumours, 
but its truth on this occasion was soon appa- 
rent to everyone. Within ten minutes of his 
deatli having been signalled to H. M. S. 
Philomel” a naval party, numbering about 
160 men and armed with machine guns, were 
landed (at 9-10 p.w.) from that ship and H.M. 
S.“Blanche,” under the charge of Lieut. A. B. 
G. Grenfell, whilst a party of marines were 
landed at the Consulate to form a guard for 
Mr. Reimell Rodd, H. M. Diplomatic Agent, 
who, accompanied by Captain Campbell, Se- 
nior Naval Officer, proceeded with this escort 
towards the Palace : the Blue-jackets joined 
this party at the Custom House and marched 
thence to the Palace, where they found Gene- 
al Mathews, First Minister of the Govern- 
ment, to whose coolness and presence of mind 
must be attributed the fact that- the Arabs in 
the vicinity of the Palace had not already re- 
sorted to violence to force an entry. Ad- 
mittance was demanded and at first 
re-1 
fused, and it was reported that 
arm- 
cd force of Arabs had heen seen approach- 
ing the Palace hut had turned back 
when they saw the naval force being landed 
on the beach : for a brief interval matters 
looked serious, and the Persian guard being 
in possession of a loaded machine gun and 
oecupyingone corner of the Palace square ap- 
peared to be also an element of danger,though 
this was shortly removed by their placing 
themselves under the orders of General 

was at this time 
Khalid, who had 
taken forcible 
possession: Captain Camp- 
bell, who had been desired by Mr. Bodd to 
take military charge of affairs, then brought 
up a gun to the Palace door to effect 
an entry by force if necessary, hut, Said 
bin Khalid thought it wisest not to prolong 
the opposition and opened the doors. A 
search was then instituted and Captain Camp- 
bell proceeded to the upper storey of the Pa- 
lace, followed by Mr. Rodd and a guard of 
marines, the Brigade being left in charge of 
the Square under the command of Lieut. 
Grenfell. Said bin Khulid was at once made 
prisoner and sent under a guard to his own 
house where he was kept a close prisoner. 
The prompt action of the authorities in 
taking charge of the Palace prevented the 
Treasure Room being broken into and rubbed; 
aud in fact there does not appear to have been 
any looting either in the Palace or about the

Rodd, he was declared Sultan, and the Pro- 
clamation publicly read at 11 r.-ir. from the 
steps of the Palace, the Naval Brigade 
presenting arms, and the buglers sounding- 
a royal salute. The naval brigade was 
then divided into two parties, one remaining 
on shore for service and the other returning to 
their ships: the party remaining on shore 
was relieved early on Monday morning. 
On the news becoming known in town, 
there was a general closing and barring of 
houses and shops; parties of native troops and 
military police with fixed bayonets patrol- 
led the main streets, giving orders for doors 
to he closed, while at various points about the 
town and suburbs there was a well-timed dis- 
play of native troops and military police also 
with fixed bayonets. The news was received 
quietly and after the first excited hum of en- 
quiring voices had died away, the only sound 
to be heard was the loud wailing fi-oni the
