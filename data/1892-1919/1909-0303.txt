London, 24th February. 

Tire question of peace or war seems to 
be mainly dependent upon the amount of 
pressure exercised on Belgrade by the 
Powers. 
London, 25th February. 

Hen ter learns that the apprehensions 
regarding the Balkan situation expressed 
elsewhere are not shared by London where 
while the approach of Spring causes some 
uneasiness, no single incident which has 
recently occurred is regarded in itself as 
sufficient occasion lor increased alarm.

The House of Commons has rejected by 
33(5 votes to 218 the Amendment regarding 
the situation in Ireland and by '95 votes to 
90 the Amendment regretting the coercive] 
measures being taken, in India. 

The situation in the Balkans continues 
to be gloomy owing to the uncertainty of 
the attitude which Russia will take up. 
The Tsar has called out numerous classes 
of the best educated Reservists lor six 
weeks training for the first t-imo since the 
Russo-Japanese war. The Russian news- 
papers appear to anticipate war. Herr 
Forgach, the Austrian Minister, lias arrived 
in Vienna and his leaving Belgrade is re- 
garded as a hint to Hcrvia that Austria is 
becoming impatient. 
London, 2Gth February. 

The Naval Conference lias its final 
sitting tomorrow. There are signs that 
there w'ill lie a declaration embodying an 
agreement upon a large number of thorny 
matters which arc satisfactorily settled.

It is announced in Paris that hi. Picard 
has conceded reductions amounting to 
30,000,QUO francs on tire sum originally 
asked for in connection with the reform of 
the Navy and an agreement is probable. 

The Vienna Bourse is easier on account 
of reports that Russia will probably join 
the Powers in representations to Belgrade. 

London, 27th February. 

Tire alarms as to the situation in the 
Balkans are decreasing. It was announced 
simultaneously that Russia is to join the 
Powers in inducing Servia not to insist on. 
territorial compensation and that the 
Austro-Turkish agreement had been signed 
and tire boycott withdrawn. Markets have, 
advanced. 

The Liberal Federation has passed a

expenditure.

London, 27th February. 

It is officially announced that the Naval. 
Conference Iras signed a declaration consist- 
ing of 71 Articles which, however, will not 
be published before 20th March. 

Mr. Haldane stated that Brighton and 
London which had hitherto been indifferent, 
now led the Territorial movement and that 
the recent progress made proved the practi- 
cability of voluntary effort.

London, 2nd March. 

8jy7 March. 

The House of Commons has voted a 
supplementary estimate of P 9,100,000 for 
the Old Age Pensions. This is an increase 
of 80% as compared with the estimate for 
first three months. 

Austria notifies semi-officially that Servia 
must now formally announce to Austria her 
renunciation of ail demands for autonomy 
in Bosnia and Herzegovina and territorial 
compensation; she is also to promise to 
behave peacefully and to ask Austria for 
economic concessions. This intimation is 
regarded as somewhat needlessly haughty. 
In the House of Commons Mr. Lloyd 
George said that the greatness of the cost 
of the Old Age Pensions showed the depth, 
of need and the amount of hidden poverty. 
This, he stated, was revealed especially in 
Ireland which was an appaling disgrace to 
a civilised country. The Act had disclosed 
600,000 aged people who were disdaining 
the charity of the State. He further pro- 
mised an enquiry as regards Ireland where 
it was alleged that 27,000 people who were 
not entitled to it had received pensions and 
said that if the critics waited for the Bud- 
get he would show how he could get money 
from those who were well to do. 

Pursuant to an order of H. B. M. Court

ceased, died at Zanzibar on the 2nd day of

The following is the result of the poll at 

the Central Glasgow bye-election :— 
Et. Hon. C. Seott Dickson (U) 
Mr. Gibson Bowles (C) 

Tariff reformer 7298 
.7185 
The previous election resulted as iollows:-

Et. Hon. ('. S. Dickson (U) tl)19 
London, 4th March. 

Renter telegraphs from Grey town that 
Dini/mlu has been sentenced to four years 
imprisonment and tined one hundred pounds 
for harbouring rebels. 

Mr. Asquith speaking in the House of 
Commons said that the question of atrial 
navigation occupied the attention of the 
Government and that provision was made 
in the kavy and Army estimates to ensure 
that the problem of the use of airships in 
warfare would be fully investigated in both 
departments. 

Mr. Taft was inaugurated as President 
at Washington amidst a snowstorm. In his 
address lie generally endorsed Mr. Roose- 
velt’s policy as regards trusts and convokes 
a special session of Congress on 15th instant 
to revise the tariff with the object of secur- 
ing adequate revenue and the protection 
of home industries. He urges that a strong 
Army and Navy is the best safeguard in 
the interests of peace. 
London, 5th March. 

Washington is isolated owing to a bliz- 
zard. Sixty trains which were conveying 
visitors to the inauguration ceremony are 
snowed up and thousands of people have 
stopped in cities cn route, abandoning the 
journey. The ceremony of inauguration 
was performed in the Senate Chamber 
instead of on the steps of the Capitol as 
is customary. 

London, 5th March.

The following is the result of the South 

Edinburg by e-el ec ti on:— 

Lewar (L) 8185 
Cox (U) (19(34 

oth March. 

Mr. Arthur Lewar, k. c., has been ap- 

pointed Solicitor General for Scotland. 

London, 4th March. 

King Edward starts for Biarritz to-day. 
It is announced that he is making the visit 
on account of his health as he did last year, 
the doctors advising him to absent himself 
from England during the months of March 
and April. 

This is the sixth day of snow in Great 
Britain, the average depth being six inches. 
There are general snowstorms throughout 
Europe. 

The domineering tone of the Austrian 
semi-official press which is insisting that 
Servia must appeal to Austria alone and 
denying the right of third parties to inter- 
vene is producing a grave impression espe- 
cially in Russia, where the Slav opinion 
vehemently favours Servia, thus making 
M. Isvolsky’s position' extremely difficult. 
In the meantime the Servian ministry is 
desirous of following M. Isvolsky’s advice, 
while saving its own face. Altogether the 
situation is full of complications, especially 
with regard to Austrians and Servians who 
are repeatedly exchanging shots across the 
River Drina. 

•King Edward has postponed his departure 
until to-morrow owing to the inclemency 
of the weather. 

The previous election resulted as follows:- 

Lewar (L) S945 
Smith (C) 5985 

An official statement emanating from 
Belgrade says that Servia is appreciating 
the efforts being made by the Powers to 
maintain peace and that she is content to 
abide by the decision of the Powers. 

Mr. Haldane speaking on the Army- 
estimates mentioned that the troops in 
South Africa, Egypt and Malta are to be 
readjusted to form a nucleus division. 

The actual terms of Servia's reply to 
Russia are not disclosed but it is known 
that she withdraws all claims and is pre- 
pared to abide by the decision of Europe. 
The reply has produced a mollifying effect 
on the Austrian Press but it remains to he 
seen what attitude Baron von Aehrenthal 
will adopt. 

King Edward has proceeded to Paris 

cn route for Biarritz. 
London, tlth March. 

The Nonldeutsche Zeituiuj annouces the 
impending reduction of the East Asiatic 
force from 750 to 150. 

Prince Ferdinand of Bulgaria has gone 
to Bukharest for two days to visit the King.
