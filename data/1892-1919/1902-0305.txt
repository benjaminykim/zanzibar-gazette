'llth February. 

Although the various Delegates have 
-agreed to the principle of the abolition of the 
sugar bounties and the reduction of duties, 
there appears to be a deadlock over the 
question of the extent of the reduction. 
England and France insist on a reduction 
to five francs. German}' and Austria are 
unwilling to reduce below fifteen francs- 
It is believed that Germany ultimately 
will yield but Austria’s acceptance is 
doubtful. 

The Pope has received the Bishop of 
Port Victoria, Vicar Apostolic of Uganda. 
The Government has been defeated in 
the House of Commons. Mr. Norton 
submitted a motion regarding excessive 
hours of work for railway men. Mr. 
Gerald Bqlfour stated he was willing to 
accept in a modified form of motion but it 
was carried in its original form by 151 to 
144 votes. 

The Centenary of Victor Hugo was 
celebrated yesterday in Paris as a great 
national event. 

A despatch from Lord Kitchener states 
that an empty convoy was attacked ten 
miles from Klerksdorp and after severe 
fighting -svas captured. The escort consisted 
of the 5th Yeomanry three companies of 
the Northumberlands with two guns. No 
details are given. The Boers evidently 
came from a. considerable distance having 
been pursued. 

Another despatch from General Byng 
reports that 600 Boers from South driving 
cattle attempted on the 2drd of February to 
rush an outpost on the line South of 
Bothasberg; a certain number, got through. 
The New Zealanders behaved with the 
greatest gallantry. The Boers left 15 dead 
and 16 wounded. 

The New Zealanders at Bothusherg lost 

two officers and 3d men wounded. 

28W February. 

Lord Bosebery lias authorised the forma- 
tion of a Liberal League with himself as 
President, and Messrs. Asquith and Fowler 
and Sir Edward Grey as Vice Presidents, 
for the purpose of co-operating with the 
Liberal Party on the lines of his Chesterfield 
Policy, though not seceding from the party. 
The Earl of Deoleigh has gone to Borne 
as special envoy from the King to congratu- 
late the Pope on his Pontifical Jubilee. 
At the invitation of the Canadian Govern- 
ment Prince Henry will spend a few hours 
on the 5th of March on the Canadian side 
of Niagara. 

1st March. 

The Times correspondent at Peking tele- 
graphs that the German|agreement for the 
acquisition of a] IminingiJ monopoly at 
Shantung, is on the eve of a settlement. 

It will confer great political advantages 
and practically close a large part of 
Shantung to British and American trade. 

The casualty lists contain the names of 
eighteen wounded belonging to the escort 
of the captured convoy. 

Lord Kitchener telegraphs from Harri- 
smith on 28tli of February, that the opera- 
tions along the Harrismith and Vaureenen 
blockhouse line for the past two days have 
resulted m 600 Boers being killed and 
captured, and '2,000 horses and 28,000 cattle 
taken. The prisoners include De Wet’s sou 
and Secretary. 

Lord Kitchener adds that these very 
satisfactory results are appropriate on 
Majuba day. 

The sugar convention is expected to be 
signed in a day or two. It provides for the 
abolition of all bounties, the reductions of 
the Import Duties to a uniform of 6 francs 
from the 1st of September 1903, and the 
imposition of countervailing duties against 
those States continuing to give bounties. 

The further list of casualties to the 

convoy show 99 to have been wounded. 

M. Waldeck-Rousseau Las been badly 
cut and bruised by an electric tram over- 
turning his carriage, killing the horse. 

maren. 

f Lord Kitchener reports that 16 officers 
and 451 men were captured at Klerksdorp 
rom the convoy of whom 106 were released. 
Colonel Anderson, the Y'eomanry Com- 
mander, was retained as a prisoner. 

Prince Henry has left Washington on a 
tour in the West and South West of the 
United States. 

The sugar conference has agreed to the 
outstanding points, the convention will be 
finally drafted and it is probable will be 
signed in a few days. 

M. Waldeck-Rousseau is suffering con- 
siderable pain and has passed a feverish 
night. The Rointgen rays will be applied 
to his shoulder. Even President Loubet 
has not been allowed to see him. 

The carriage was caught and smashed 
between two tramcars. The Premier’s face 
was drenched with blood, and dressing it 
was difficult, the wounds being filled with 
atoms of glass. 

Lord Kitchener telegraphs that at 
Volksrust the Boer casualties were 50 killed 
and ten wounded, 759 unwounded being 
taken prisoners. Excluding the numbers 
killed and wounded, it is reported that over 
100 men were taken away when the block- 
house lino was broken on the 24th of 
February. Apart from the casualties to the 
New Zealanders already reported, ours were 
one officer killed and four men wounded. 

AI. Waldeck-Rousseau is improving and 

his condition is satisfactory. 

A serious rebellion has broken out at 
Nanning ; the insurgents include 1,000 ox- 
soldiers. The Diplomatic Corps have 
warned China against the necessity of 
protecting foreigners and suppressing the 
rebellion. 

Messrs. M essels and Wolmarans, the 
Boer Delegates, have arrived at Washington. 
The Roentgen rays examination lias 
shown that no fracture of M. Waldeck- 
Kousseau’s shoulder exists, but there is 
considerable effusion of blood round the 
joint. 

Thirty-six police have been injured, 
eleven qf them seriously, by the 
“unemployed” riot in ParU 

Cases of plague occur daily in Sydney 
amongst the deaths, two of these being 
popular actresses. 

Mr. Chamberlain has adopted a resolution 
approving the principle of a two years 
military service, also amendments to the 
army estimates, reducing the periods of 
annual training, and increasing the soldiers 
allowances of liquors and provisions. 

A statue of Victor Hugo was unveiled in 
the place named after him in the presence 
of a multitude of people, at a popular fete 
yesterday. 

ith March. 

A further list of casualties to the convoy 

shows five officers and 45 men killed. 

The Times states that with the view of 
averting a failure of the sugar conference 
England undertook' not to adopt a pre- 
ferential tariff in favour of any British 
Colony producing cane sugar. Any future 
increase in the Customs Duty will be 
applicable nil round. 
’ tith March. 
Lord Kitchener reports that Colonel 
Anderson, who commanded the convoy, has 
arrived at Kraaspan, with nine officers and 
245 men. They repulsed two attacks, then 
the convoy advanced slowly, when a third 
and very determined attack was begun in 
force. The enemy charged getting between 
the flanking guard and the convoy, 
stampeding all the mules; and throwing the 
infantry into confusion. The troops fought 
gallantly exhausting nearly all their rifie 
and Pom Pom ammunition. The enemy 
are reported to have numbered 1200 to 1700.

The Sugar convention comes into force 
on tho 1st of September 190S for five years 
thereafter, being terminable at a year’s 
notice. 

Great Britain undertakes to submit the 
convention to her self-governing Colonies 
and India, to enable them to adhere to it. 

Lord Kitchener’s weekly, report gives the 
result of the operations as 84 Boers killed 
and wounded aud 1008 prisoners and 
surrendered. 
- Mr. Brodrick in introducing the Army 
estimates said that service with the colours 
would be for three years, and nine years in 
the reserve. Pay would be increased to a 
shilling a day from the 1st of March aud the 
1st of April. Soldiers after two years 
service could elect to go into the reserve or 
to complete eight years with the colours

THE GAZETTE. 

NAKED AND NOT ASHAMED, 

The campaign of lying by pen and pencil on 
the Continent has passed into that stage when 
the authors and artists no longer pretend to have 
the faintest excnser for what they produce, beyond 
envy, hatred, malice, and an over-mastering 
passion for Boer money. Writers, artist?, 
lecturers, vie with each other in committing 
atrocities! which they admit, with a cynical 
grin, are either prompted by sheer detestation 
of Great Britain, or, having been paid for by 
Dr. Leyds, are supplied just in the same way as 
a professional poisoner dn the days of ancient 
Borne would furnish any deadly drug for money. 
The Times is publishing a series of articles on 
“The Literature of German Anglophobia,” which 
shows how even respectable journals, associated 
with the names of great artists anti writers, have 
poured forth the vilest slanders, knowing them 
to be untrue. The Times observes: “It is worth 
noting that, if one studies the genesis of the 
calumnies which have gone the round of the 
German Press, one finds that the pictorial 
calumny in most cases precedes, and appears 
to have inspired, the written calumny. First 
comes the libellous cartoon; and then the ex- 
Boer commandant or the German volunteer or 
the letter from an anonymous Teuton in Pretoria, 
promptly follows with the specific allegations 
required to corroborate the whole charge. The 
‘artist* manures the soil, the ‘writer,’ as soon as 
it has been made sufficiently receptive—no very 
difficult task, unfortunately—scatters over it with 
a generous hand his ever-ready seed stock of 
lies.” We need hardly point out that this Press 
campaign of unabashed calumny lias not been 
confined to Germany, but has been and is still 
general on the Continent. Amongst one of the 
most venomous of the Dutch papers, the Nieive 
It otter damsche Courant, has earned disgraceful 
distinction, and that delectable organ, for some 
reason or other, has explained that lying is ;dl 
in the way of business. The editor seems quite 
astonished that anyone should have thought 
otherwise, and his ingenuous statement throws 
a flood of light on the origin of these infamous 
attacks in the Continental Press. Of course we 
have been aware, ever since they began, of their 
true source, but the callousness of the journal 
we have mentioned in “owning up,” tor no 
apparent reason, should' surely enlighten even 
the dark mind of the average pro-Boer in this 
country. Here it is in all its naked simplicity:— 
“When we published accounts of Boer 
vounded and prisoners being killed at Eland- 
slaagfco, it was at the instigation of the Transvaal 
Ambassador, and from hispurse we were paid.’’ 
Perhaps the “Transvaal Ambassador” is 
getting stingy, but any way, we find the journal 
still coming out with its inspired announcements. 
“Is it,” asks the Rotterdam paper, in the article 
referred to. -a discovery to And ’that lie (Dr. 
Leyds is responsible?’: Certainly not, but for 
cool impudence we never read the like, of this. 
Dr. Leyds is, of course, also ••responsible” for

the peripatetic liars who are making “revelations” 
all over the Continent. They know perfectly 
well that they are lying, but so long as tho 
money comes in, it is all one to them. One of the 
stars of this new profession is the unspeakable ' 
Sandberg, who, at a Parisian meeting attended 
by 4000 paople, read a letter, or what purported 
to be one, from ex-President Steyn, in which 
he accused English soldiers of having, on June 
6, 1901, cannonaded a convoy of Boer women 
who were escaping in carts. Loud shouts of 
“A has les Anglais!” “Death to England!” 
“Shame to the women-killers,” &c., greeted the 
reading of this letter. There are no words with 
which we are acquainted, available to describe 
the conduct of men who tell such infernal lies, 
knowing they lie, and glory in their infamy. 
Scarcely a shade less culpable is the conduct of 
the pro-Boers who affect to believe them. 

South Africa." 

EUROPE AND THE UNITED 

STATES. 

The eagerness with which the semi-official 
Press of £he Continent is seeking to discredit 
Loud Ckaniiobne’s account of the communica- 
tions between the Powers on the Spanish- 
American war seems likely to defeat itself. 
The Americans, with their usual good sense, 
are not disposed to bear a permanent 'grudge 
against the Governments and the {peoples who 
misjudged the situation and espoused the losing 
cause four years ago. They are quite ready, 
as a distinguished citizen told our Washington 
Correspondent, to be friends with Powers who 
in 1898 were no friends to them, but they 
“know the facts, and do not care to be taken 
for fools.” They know the facts better now than 
they knew them when this pithy summary of 
the situation was uttered, for it wasjgiven before 
Loud Cranborne’s reply to Mr. Borman. 
Nowhere, as the American papers observe, has 
any attempt been made to deny Lord 
Cranborne’s narrative of what took place. It 
is hinted, however, in various quarters that 
others Powers were at least as friendly to the 
United States as Great Britain, and even that 
it was not her action, but the alleged action of 
another State, which baffled the anti-American 
project. We shall content ourselves with 
remarking that, so far, there is no evidence ju 
support of these contentions. If it exists, it 
can be produced. Unf il it is produced assertions 
as to its nature will not greatly impress impartial 
investigators into this interesting historical 
incident. 

Until that evidence is forthcoming the 
American public seem likely to remain 
convinced that England and England alone 
showed practical “ effective friendship ” to 
their country in the day of her trial. 
Neither they nor we pretend that our 
conduct at that time was dictated wholly by 
considerations of sentiment. Our interests were 
on the side of America, and we had sagacity 
enough to understand that this was the case. 

Marcli 5, 1902. 

Sentiment, at the same time, entered largely 
into our motives. VV e were honestly glad, as 
we always are, to be. able honestly to co-operate 
with the great people who inherit our language, 
our religion, and our manners. We did them a 
service at a very critical time. They recognized 
the fact long ago, and they recognize it more 
clearly after Lon D Oeasboexe’s careful announce- 
ment. They will recognize it more fully yet, 
when the details of the negotiations come to be 
known. They are not ungrateful, as the tone of 
their chief journals and tho words of their public 
men sufficiently show. Naturally the Powers 
whose efforts to injure them we thwarted are not 
anxious that they should learn the whole truth.

NOTES. 

His Excellency the Goveenoh of 
German East Africa passed Zanzibar on 
Sunday night on board tbe Kaiser Wilbelm 
on his way to Mombasa. He is paying a 
call to British East Africa, where we 
understand he will be the guest of Sir 
Charles Eliot, and intends going up the 
railway line. 

Mb. and Mbs. Cave left by the last 
French mail for England. Their departure 
was rather sudden; Mr. Cave having applied 
for leave of absence on urgent private 
affairs, received a reply on the very morning 
of the day when the mail left. 

Mb. Henby Dundas who has for some 
years past been H. M’s Vice-Consul for 
German East Africa, residing at Dar-es- 
Salaam, has been appointed Vice-Consul at 
Galatz in Koumania, which post he will 
shortly take up. We congratulate Mr. 
Dundas on this advantageous exchange, as 
however pleasant Dar-es-Salaam may he, it 
cannot certainly be compared to the ideal 
climate on the shores of the Danube. 

Me. Shaw of the Bible Society left to-day 
for Mombasa on his way to the Tana 
district where he intends making an 
extensive tour in the interest of his Society. 
H. M. S. Forte left on Saturday morning 
for Mombasa where she will spend about 
a fortnight. Both the Forte aud Partridge 
will shortly proceed to Simonstown to pay 
off and recommission for this station. 

The storm which raged iu the Indian 
Ocean last month appears to have caused a 
lot of damage at Beira and other places on 
the Mozambique littoral. We read in the 
Beira Post that the s. s. “Canara" was 
unable to get in that port and had to prccerd 
to Delagoa-Bay, causing great anxiety 
meanwhile through being greatly overdue

dth March. 

The rebellion in Kwangsi is spreading; 
tlie insurgents have murdered a French 
officer at Tong-King. 

j The Civil Service estimates provide a 
grant in aid for the East Africa Protectorate 
increased by £151,000 over last year which 
is partly counterbalanced by a reduction of 
£37,000 in the grant in aid for Uganda. 

A further sum of £770,000 has been 
borrowed for the purposes provided for by 
the Uganda Railway Acts. 

Till March. 

The Sugar Convention has been signed. 
The Reichstag has voted a grant for 
investigation into the causes &c. of cancer. 
The Minister stated that 12,000 cases 
examined in Germany showed that it was 
contagious not hereditary. 

The Tsar has renewed his invitation to 
President Loubet, who is expected to 
arrive at Cronstadt on the 10th of May. 

Mr. Gerald Balfour speaking at a dinner 
of the Association of Chambers of Commerce 
stated that the signature of the Sugar 
Convention was a triumph of British 
diplomacy and a victory for free trade. 

Mr. Hay and President Roosevelt in 
succession received the Boers Wolmarans 
and Wessels as private visitors. After 
listening to them for fifteen minutes 
President Roosevelt stated that the United 
States could not and would not interfere 
in the struggle in South Africa. 

Sth March. 

Over a- hundred more of the convoy 
escort hajre rejoined the main -body which 
has already arrived at Kraaspam 

The Civil Service estimates for 1902-3 
provide for a grant pif .£1,800,000 in aid 
of the revenues of the Transvaal and the 
Orange Colony. 

Prince. Henry yesterday visited the 
Canadian side of the Niagara Falls and was 
met midway by Major F. S. Maude, Lord 
Minto’s Military Secretary; various civilities 
■were exchanged. 

The ceaseless receptions and attentions 
paid to Prince Henry in the American 
Towns are tiring out His Highness. 

10W. March. 

Mr. Cecil Rhodes is unwell, at present 
staying at Cape Town. His condition 
causes anxiety. 

During debate on the Army Estimates, 
Mr. Brodrick stated, that at the present 
rate of operations, and with the very large 
surrenders of the last two months, he had 
a right to expect that before the eight or 
nine months specified in the estimates, 
there would be a substantial reduction in 
the British forces to be maintained in South I 
Africa. In all probability and speaking' 
generally, the garrison of 15,000 British j 
troops in South Africa, would be sufficient, 
after the present crisis, besides the local 
forces and constabulary. 

110 Pilgrims have died of cholera at 

Medina. 

The Explorer Captain Casati, the com- 

rade of Emin, is dead. 

Mr. Cecil Rhodes, it is now stated, is 
suffering from angina pectoris, the heart is 
considerably enlarged, and oxygen is being 
administered.

to go out in a few days. j 
11. M. the King is going to Nice. He 
will stay at Paris for two days to have an 
interview with President Loubet. 

Lord Kitchener telegraphs that the 
columns operating about Reitz since the 
4th of March, have captured 35 Boers. 

Colonel Rimington has discovered in a 
cave 300,009 Martini Henry cartridges 
10.000 Lee Mctfords, several hundred shells 
and fuses, one Maxim and two Heliographs. 
Ibis cave is believed to be an important 
depot of De ATet’s. The columns found a 
number of wounded Boers in the same 
district. | 

I Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman’s resolu, 
I tion to appoint a committee to enquire into 
the Army contracts for South Africa, has 
been fixed for the 19th of March. Virtually 
the motion is a censure on the Government- 
I During the last two days, great progress 
is being made in Johannesberg. The town 
I is very busy, and has ample supplies of 
necessaries, even luxuries. The mines are ' 
j restarting as fast as possible. 
I President Loubet goes to Cronstadt on 
I board the Massenet,” and will he escorted 
I by four men-of-war. 

In a discussion in the French Chamber, 
the Minister M. Caillaux stated that the 
suppression of the sugar bounties, was the 
most salutary work accomplished for a long 
time. There would be no change in the 
I present regime until the 1st of September 
1903. 

The Senate has passed the Shipping 

Bounties Bill, with some amendments. 

A dispute about land within the French 
Concession at Tientsin, has arisen. The 
French have stopped the American Missions 
from building therein, and posted policemen 
on the ground. The American Consul 
. hoisted flags on the buildings and referred 
the matter to his Minister at Peking. •
