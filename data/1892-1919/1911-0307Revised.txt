constitutional conference the question 
of the publication of the points on which the 
constitutional conference failed or agreed has been 
brought up in parliament mr ASQUITH 
informed the hon harry LAWSON that all members of 
the conference were agreed that there should be 
no public disclosure of the proceedings and that 
he did not possess the power even if he had the 
disposition which he had not to consider the 
matter 

house of commons during the second 
reading in parliament of the veto bill mr AUSTEN 
chamberlain put forward an amendment urging 
the reconstruction of the house of lords and said 
that if the bill was the governments last word 
it could not pass he appealed for a compromise 
in the spirit of the conference 

mr ATHWART WAGON suggested that the subsidy 
of 9000 per annum paid for the conveyance of 
mails to mombasa might be more profitably 
employed in running a special steamer which 
could carry the coast mails and develop local 
resources colonel seely replied that the scheme 
had been examined and found unreliable 

last weeks discussion has rather exhausted 
the interest in the debate the house was 
listless and in no wise full and air AUSTEN 
lain said that all ministerial arguments only 
proved that the house of lords ought to be 
reformed so as to be more fitted for its task the 
two years delay provided for in the hill was 
useless and moreover once the bill was passed 
nothing could prevent the house of commons 
from abandoning the system established because 
the house of commons would then be supreme 

mr HALDANE said that air AUSTEN 
lain had spoken as if the bill was the whole 
policy of the government the bill was the only 
means of making any step forward towards the 
strongly favoured reform of the house of lords 
as security against the repeal of the hill the 
government pledged themselves not to treat this 
as a final settlement hut as a stepping stone to 
reforms connected with ireland elections and

veto bill there is a revival of interest at 
the concluding stage of the cto bill and the 
house was crowded mr BALFOUR said that though 
he held that a democratic form of government 
was the only form under which it was possible to 
live peaceably and carry out EFFECTIVELY national 
and imperial work it was folly to say that they 
will have nothing to do with heredity on principle 
because it was impossible to avoid the second 
chamber rivalling the first THE party of rapid 
change ought to have a constitutional check to 
ensure that the changes were approved by the 
people this he said was more necessary in the 
case of the liberals than the conservatives it 
was of the utmost importance to have a second 
chamber strong enough to carry out functions and 
as the government wanted a second chamber he 
supposed they wanted a real and not merely an 
ornamental and useless one the government 
he stated could not be trusted to amend the 
constitution responsibly and impartially because they 
were not independent but coerced by the irish 
otherwise the bill would never have appeared in 
its present shape he said that the results would 
probably be disastrous to the country and 
certainly DISCREDITABLE to yourselves you are doing 
what you have no right to do using to 
TRANSFER relatively few votes and fundamentally change 
the constitution you are going to carry out by 
coercion what you have imposed on the country 
by fraud at this there was a prolonged uproar 
and cries of withdraw but the speaker ruled 
that there was no objection to the word fraud as 
applied to a party and not an individual the 
uproar was renewed for some time but the 
adhered to his ruling mr BALFOUR refused to 
withdraw anything he had said and concluded in 
a few words 

mr ASQUITH said that they now knew that the 
tory anxiety as regards the reform of the house 
of lords was to make it however composed 
stronger against the chosen representatives of the 
people mr BALFOUR had charged them with fraud 
by advocating a scheme which they did not 
believe to be just in order to obtain the support of 
rationalists the answer was that the bill 
the 

originated by sir h campbell bannerman s 
motion in 1907 when the liberals were 
independent of all parties they had not deviated a hairs 
breadth from the lines then laid down which 
were without any reference to party convenience 
referring to the hereditary principle he said that 
it was because they were enslaved and fettered 
in the house of commons that they meant to 
cany the bill through and make it law and that 
constitutional checks were abundantly provided 
in the bill they must presume that the 
representative house was the true mouthpiece of 
the people and therefore no further check was 
required the preamble distinctly stated that 
the reconstruction should be postponed until the 
operative clauses came into force therefore in 
assenting to the bill the country endorsed the 
course they were pursuing his view of the 
desirability of a second chamber was not changed 
in the least hut the house of commons must 
predominate in legislation the only functions 
of the second chamber must be consultation and 
revision the opposition asked them to hold 
their hands till a vast and crude formless change 
in the constitution had been thought out but he 
said that the governments first and paramount 
duty was to pass this bill and make it law

march 1911 

the appellant in this case DICTED 
tans subject was one of j1166 PP a british 
of the theft of a watch and chain from 
subject named ISMAIL lhanji JUG 
the first point taken in the appeal DEAD foe 
magistrates trial was upon laozi-ends 
want of jurisdiction loth of THESE g 
based upon the wording of article OF io 
1906 which isasfolohdiction 
the court shall exercise CUMINAL I 
over zanzibar subjects accused t to THIS 
an offence against any person siihjec 
order and in such cases there shall be no u 
to the high court of bombay that the 
it is first argued for the ALTO ab 
jurisdiction hereby CONFERRED does not j 
cases where the actual prosecutor as DISGIG ag 
from the complainant is a ZANZIBAR is 
the zanzibar police prosecuted in PLP 
contended that the jurisdiction doe NOT 
the old practice of the court for a num 
years past would seem to lend CHIOU 
argument but that practice w AS j d the 
upon the treaty of 1886 which ESTATES 
delegated court and upon the WON s a p 
sultans decree of the OF shahaan ENTER 
1899 the treaty is now ABROGATED w 

march A 1911 

the gazette 

A 

is repealed and the wording of article OF A of 
the 1906 is couched in 
phraseology entirely different from that of the treaty 
and the decree these latter therefore afford 
us no assistance and we are unable to agree with 
air eramjis argument upon the distinction 
between cognizable and not-cognizable offences 
we feel bound to follow only the words of article 
OF A of the from those 
words it is quite obvious that it is of no 
importance whether the police or the individual 
prosecutes the only question is whether the party 
is accused of committing an offence 
against a person subject to the order that is 
clearly the case here n 

it is secondly argued that the words offence 
any person subject to this order must 
bet united to offences against the person as 
distinguished from all the other offences enumerated 
in the indian penal code e g offences against the 
state against public tranquility against public 
justice affecting coin and government stamps 
affecting decency and morals against property 
and so on it is therefore contended that the 
offence in this case theft does not confer the 
JURISDICTION exercised by the magistrate 

steal one watch from the person of another man 
it is we think reasonably clear that two of the 
accused should have been charged not with theft 
but with the abetment of theft 

the defects in a judgment however can be 
cured under section 537 of the criminal 
CELURE code if these defects have not in fact 
occasioned a failure of justice we follow the 
judgment in criminal appeal no I of 1910 of 
h OF m court reported in the zanzibar gazette 
of the RD may 1910 at page OF and the 
authorities there referred to but while we are of 
opinion that here as in that case there has in 
fact been no failure of justice we would express 
the hope that the magistrate will in future 
judgments comply fully with the requirements of 
section 367 of the code and frame the exact 
charge WHICH each accused has to meet see 
KALE mirza v the emperor 1910 OF c at p OF 
the third point in the appeal is that the trial is 
had because although the sentence on the 
appellant was partially based upon his previous 
convictions the charge against the appellant 
contained no clause referring to those previous 
convictions TO 

we do not agree with this view for two 
reasons first we think that inasmuch as this 
JURISDICTION is based upon a grant of 
exterritomality the intention of the legislature was that a 
british subject against whom in any way a 
crime was committed should have the benefit of 
such protection as a british court affords we 
do not think the legislature intended that that 
protection should extend only to direct assaults 
upon his person hut not to offences against ms 
property secondly we think that if the 
TRUE had intended article OF A to be confined 
within the limits contended for the wording 
would have been not offences against any 
person subject to this order but offences against 
the person of anyone subject to this order or 
some similar phraseology showing clearly that the 
narrower meaning was intended 
we hold therefore in regard to this first point 
in the appeal that the magistrate had jurisdiction 
to try the case 

the second point in this appeal is that there 
was no judgment in the magistrate s court e 
judgment of the magistrate is as FOLLOWS 

verdict guilty proofs of previous convictions 

follow 


no I and no A took the active part in the 
case and are very bad characters no A is much 
younger hut is also a bad lot

it is true that this judgment fails considerably 

short of the requirements of sec 367 o e 
FINAL procedure code that section provides 
inter alia that the judgment SHALL contain the 
point or points for determination t e 
thereon the reasons for the decision an 
a specific statement of the offence of w NC 
the section of the penal code under vin 
accused is convicted it is argued no 

reason that almost all of these ELM I 
missing from the judgment now MUD pi i 
is further argued that whereas ml three accused 
in this case were charged with THE t 
SIBLE that three meu could at the same mome 

this question is not without difficulty it is 
quite clear that where in consequence of previous 
convictions section OF of the indian penal code 
is relied upon for an enhancement of the ordinary 
limit of sentence which the court is competent 
to GIVE a charge must he framed under sec OF 
qe v dorasani 1886 A m 284 the charge 
of the previous convictions should not be read 
out until the prisoner has been found guilty 
when he has been found guilty the charge is 
read and when the previous convictions are 
eitheradmitted or properly proved they can be used to 
pass under section OF a higher sentence than 
could he inflicted upon the prisoner under the 
ordinary section of the penal code that deals 
with the offence in question 

that however is not the case here the 
point before us is this the accused was 
proceeded against under the ordinary section of the 
code sec 379 for theft there was no charge of 
previous convictions framed against him the 
previous convictions were simply proved after the 
FINDING of guilty and the appellant thereby 
obtained a sentence which though within tire 
three years limit of the ordinary section was no 
doubt a higher sentence than he would have 
obtained had the previous convictions not been 
admitted to proof the question we have to 
answer is whether the absence of a distinct charge 
containing the previous convictions invalidate 
the trial 

we are of opinion that it does not THE 
FINAL code does not as far as we know anywhere 
lay down that it is necessary to frame a charge 
in such cases section 221 A specifically refers 
to proofs of convictions where it is desired to 
enhance under sec OF of the penal code the 
sentence which the court is ordinarily competent 
to award and all other references to the framing 
of such a charge are referable exclusively to that 
particular section of the penal code we think 
that it is for the appellants counsel to show us 
that the code definitely requires the framing of a 
charge in such ordinary cases and we do not 
feel that he has succeeded in doing so the case 
of queen-empress v dorasani 1886 A madras 
284 the head note of which is not very accurate 
does appear to support the appellant s contention 
but against that case we have to consider first 
the invariable practice of this court for the last 
twenty years and secondly the terms of a circular 

showing the practice oi the cen PAL necessary 
india that circular says that it is n unless 
to state previous convictions m the cl g cf 
it is intended to prove them fox the PUMP 
affecting the punishment which th 
competent to award that is MON could CLOT 
the accused liable to a sentence jaw such
