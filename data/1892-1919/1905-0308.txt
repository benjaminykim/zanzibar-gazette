2«d March. 

An amendment to tire Address urging 
a denunciation of the Sugar Convention in 
view of its prejudicial effect on Britain lias 
been rejected by 270 to 21L votes. 
At a meeting of bankers and financiers 
at Tokio, il was announced that the domes- 
tic loan would be doubly subscribed. 
Lord Selbourne has been appointed to 
succeed Lord Milner, who leaves South 
Africa at the end of March. 
Martial law has been proclaimed through- 
out Poland. 

3rd March. 

The House of Commons has adopted the 
address by 235 to 175 votes, after rejecting 
an amendment from Mr. Buchanan by 250 
to 201 votes demanding a reduction in the 
national expenditure. 
The Japanese left is successfully holding 
the positions they gained on Tuesday, as far 
to the west as Lia Ho, against repeated 
Russian attacks. 
Lord Selbourne's appointment has been 
favourably received and is regarded as a 
recognition of the continued importance of 
South Africa. 
Lord Lansdowne yesterday presented the 
Sultan of Zanzibar to H. M. the King at 
Buckingham Palace ; a private interview 
of considerable duration followed, the King 
displaying great cordiality. The Sultan 
was very gratified. 
The Naval Estimates are £83,3811,000 
compared with £3(3,880,000 for 1901-05. 
The decrease is mainly in new construction 
and repairs. 

l</( March. 

During the Debate on the Supplementary 
Army Estimates, the Opposition seized the 
opportunity of a small ministerial attend- 
ance to force snap divisions. The Govern- 
ment majority fell to 21 and the Debate 
was adjourned. 
Reuter Tientsin: 400 Japanese Cavalry 
have raided Sin-Min-Ting, 35 miles W. N. 
W. of Mukden. There are 10,000 Japan- 
ese along the Kaopantse line, which it is 
expected they will seize, as the ground 
has for long ceased to be neutral. 
This raid in conjunction with the ad-1 

yauce of the Japanese left is considered to 
indicate that Marshal Oyama’s armies are 
enveloping both Russian flanks while holding 
the centre. 
Tire group of Ministers engaged in draft- 
ing the Constitution have fallen into dis- 
favour, the reactionaries have regained the 
ear of the Tsar, who has issued a Mani- 
festo re-affirming autocracy and appealing 
to the whole nation to unite against the 
internal enemies and the obstinate foreign 
foe. 
The War correspondents .at the-front 
indicate that the great combined movement 
of the Japanese appears' to be succeeding 
in every quarter. 
St. Petersburg telegrams state that the 
Japanese furiously assailed the Russian 
centre and twice advanced to storm Pati- 
lolf, and were twice drived back with heavy 
losses. Kuropatkin reports that ho is 
holding the Japanese at bay, and has re- 
covered some positions from which lie had 
previously been driven out. He asserts that 
he has inflicted enormous losses on the 
Japanese, at several of their positions. 

W/t March. 

Reuter, Tokio: Many of the Russian 
positions are so strongly fortified that siege 
methods are necessary for their capture. 
The Russians on the right bank of the 
Hun-Ho have delivered heavy counter- 
attacks, which were repulsed. General Oku 
lias occupied an important position at 
Chang Zau. 
After the recent Manifesto the Russian 
Public is astonished by the publication on 
Friday night of a rescript intimating the 
Tsar’s intention to summon an Elective 
Assembly to participate in the Legislation. 
The newspapers express great satisfaction, 
but the public liesitates to express on 
opinion, and is awaiting developments. 
General Kuropatkin reports the loss of 
part of the Gaotuting defences on the 2nd 
March. The attack was continued on tire 
4th, the fighting on the left flank was 
generally the most severe, desperate Japa- 
nese attacks were repulsed again and again. 
In some places the enemy made ramparts 
of their own dead; over twenty Japanese 
battalions were repulsed on the 4th March 
at Kaudolisan with terrible losses. 
The Bienvenue and Marlin Committee 
of the French Chamber on the separation 
of Church and State have reached a com- 
plete agreement regarding the Text of the 
Bill to be submitted to the Chamber. 

A telegram has been received at Buenos 
Ayres from the French Explorer M. 
Charcot at Puerto, which says that 
he wintered at Wandcl Island and 
succeeded in completing all the scientific 
work of the Expedition, under favourable 
conditions; ail of the party were well. 
Reuter with General Kuroki, 4th March: 
The Japanese gained a signal victory: 
beyond the Hun-Ho. defeating in detail 
two Divisions of the Ifith Corps, recently 
arrived from Europe, with great slaughter, 
and capturing huge quantities of ammuni- 
tion . 
The Furl of Cawdor has been appointed 
First Lord of the Admiralty. 
Reuter Tokio: 5th' March. Marshal 
Pyama continues great drives round both 
flanks of the Russians. His front now forms 
a huge bow with the base on the ,Sha-Ho; 
the right reaches a point east of Fushun, 
the left extends to a point west of Mukden; 
he is steadily tightening this great cordon. 
General Kuropatkin is striving desperately 
to cheek these advances and contesting the 
flank eneroachmenfs, hammering at the 
Japanese centre. 
Reuter with General Kuroki 4th March. 
The Japanese are bombarding the strong- 
holds on the Russian left tremendously 
with heavy- siege guns; it seems impossible 
that these strongholds can long withstand 
projectiles of such weight. 
Reuter Mukden 4th March: A tremend- 
ous battle is raging round the Mukden posi- 
tions. The Japanese charged Kandilasan 
ten times and were always repulsed; the- 
Russians also repulsed 13 charges against 
the Kaolutin Pass. 

Tth March. 

General Kuropatkin reports that the 
advanced guards of Japanese who ate sur- 
rounding his right flank arrived on 4th 
March five miles from Mukden Station 
from the direction of the Sinminburg road. 
Reuter Mukden: The sudden appearance 
of General Nogi’s troops from the direction 
of the Lia Ho River and Sinminting has 
completely- surprised the Russians. Mukden 
is thrown into confusion and the streets 
and outlying roads are crowded with trans- 
port hastily assembling to oppose General 
Nogi. It is feared that a formidable force 
of Japanese is m route from Tub Ling, 35 
miles North of Mukden. 
Mr. Balfour has announced the resigna- 
tion of Mr. ’VVyndham. 
Reuter with General Oku 5th March; 

The Japanese left wing attacks since the 
•>aUi t'e'.raa’ V >i v been pushed home m 
the face of tremendous difficulties, heavy 
•snowstorms, and the employment of star- 
shells and searchl plus lighting up every 
uipvoment. The Japanese carried the 
nvnches, di f V wire entanglements 
and bristling with machine guns at the 
point of the bavonet despite the stubborn 
resistance of the Russians. The latter ate 
now retreating in a disorderly state, the 
men discarding arms and clothing. I he 
,)«panese captured a number oi n men 
guns, and machine guns. 

8th March; 

General Kuropatkin telegraphs on Gth 
March that his troops west of Mukden 
continue to take the offensive and repulsed 
tell attacks of the Japanese the proceeding 
day. The assaults on the centre and 
extreme left were also repulsed. ‘2000 dead 
were counted at Kaoluling where ihe 
enemy have withdrawn to the south.

The following arlielc which appears in 
the Times will interest mariners on this 
coast:—A couit of enquiry was held at 
Port Elizabeth cm December 0 and 7 I!H)4, 
to investigate the circumstauces attending 
the casualty which occurred to the British 
.steamship t.ismorc, off Zitzikama Point, 
on November 2!l, 190-1. The Court,  
placed on record their opinion that there 
wore several places on the coast in need of 
.survey. There was. they state, a wreck 
(rock'.1) off Bird Island which had never 
been located, mid only the other day a 
ship came to grief there. The Suffolk 
.foundered off Zitzikaina Point, and no 
trace of her had been found. A vessel 
foundered off Cope 1/Agulhas, and the 
Mexican struck some obstacle not mention- 

THE GAZETTE  
ed on the chart in the same place. Iher® 
had been several wrecks to the west ot 
Recife. In fact, nearly the whole coast 
line from Delagoa Bay to Cape N'Agulhas 
needed a now survey which shou.u be 
carried out as early as possible. 

We glean the following from the interest- 
ing notes kindly given us by Mr. A. Dudley 
Yorke about his trip to Kilima-njaro. He 
calls the mountain a colossal disappoint- 
ment to the globe trotter and to everybody 
else, including Germany and the natives. 
He did not reach the summit owing 
apparently to the fact that he did not have 
Hans Meyer’s map which plainly shows 
the route which, as far as is known at 
present, is the only one practicable to the 
snowcap, without cutting steps; the rest of 
the ascent appears easy. Kilima-njaro 
cannot therefore bo considered an alpinist’s 
mountain unless the lesser peaks be tried; 
these are still unconquered, in spite of 
several attempts. In fact the chief attract- 
ion to the alpinist must be the opportunity 
of getting to close on 20,000 feet with less 
trouble than perhaps ou any other mount- 
ain. Konia and Iluwenzori offer much 
nobler game. 

To the botanist, unless he be specially 
interested in ferns, Kilima-njaro offers 
nothing of unusual interest. The fact that 
strikes one most is the singular resemblance 
of the flora above the forest level to that 
which we associate with Europe. The 
entomologist will (ind very few butterflies 
above a certain level, tliougb, judging from 
experience, there must be plenty of stinging 
insects still unclassified. There are many 
birds, though small and dull coloured. As 
regards sport and Zoology, Mr. Dudley 
Yorke’s party only saw oue mammal 
though they came across numerous tracks 
of warthogs, buck and zebra near the snow- 
level. 

The most unpleasant feature about 
Kilima-njavo is getting fhere. There arc 
two ways; from J’anga the post takes ten 
days; the usual route is by Yoi and Taveta, 
including liby miles of waterless country 
and two slalions where the black anopheles 
and tsetse abound. The way lies across an 
almost shadclrss ] l iin; the road is really 
good but scarcely rises anywhere to more 
than 3000 feet, the average being 2500, 
which is still hot enough on the equator. 
At Moshi there is a sudden climb to about 
1000 feet, but coming back the party found 
it pleasanter though longer to go byKilcma 
and Marangu on the mountain side 

The country round Taveta, though 
malarious, abounds with game. Across 
from Yoi, every ten days, a Greek sends 
two donkey wagons. Whether owing to the 
tsetse or hard usage, the mortality among 
donkeys is very great. “The po.ters also 
suffered severely from heat and thirst. 
With the sudden changes of altitude, the 
rain, damp and other disagreeable circum- 
stances, we may consider ourselves fortunate 
at having had only seven cases of fever and 
being delayed only two days. It is essential 
that hooks and instruments he got from 

March 8, 1905. 

home; had we had better information we 
might have done better. But the most 
striking circumstanco of the journey was the 
difficulty we found in getting particulars 
of such a well trodden road. It may he 
useful to future travellers to know that 
two fine sleeping hags, originally belonging- 
to Nansen who. gave them tq, Hans Meyer, 
are to he found at Moshi; also two alpen- 
stocks we left behind. We left Yoi on 
12th January, arrived at Moshi the 18th, 
reached the cave 23rd, made our attempted 
ascent 21th and got hack to Yoi on 3rd 
February.” 

Judging from the above, Mr. Dudley 
Yorke seems to consider the whole trip not 
worth trying. Without wishing to criticize 
his opinion, wo cannot help thinking that 
his verdict of “a colossal disappoitment” is 
rather severe. To the European alpinist- 
accustomed to the comforts of a train de luxe 
which takes him right up to the foot of 
the peak he wishes to climb, it is natural 
that unexpected hardships and vexatious 
delays should he rather trying, but allow- 
ance has to he made for the undeveloped 
state of the country and the fact that 
Kilima-jaro is very near the equator, which 
accounts for the anopheles, tsetse and the 
“still unclassified stinging insects,” sickly 
donkeys instead of powerful locomotives 
and feverish porters in lieu of the pictures- 
que Swissi guides ready to take the 
traveller uijder their paternal care. The 
German Government are doing their best 
to develop the country and we have no 
doubt that in years to come either the 
Mombasa or Tanga railway will bring 
that majestic mountain within easy reach; 
but even in its present state the country 
presents many features of great interest, 
and in spite of the little diawbaeks 
which inevitably attend all expeditions in 
an undeveloped' tropical region, it does 
not deserve being called a colossal dis- 
appointment oven from a globe-trotter’s 
point of view. 

Last month was the driest February we 
have had since 1899, only 0.08 inches of 
of rain being recorded in town. At Bangs 
there was no rain at all during February,, 
the only recorded instance, wo believe, in 
Zanzibar island of a month passing without 
rain. The country, though dry ami thirsty, 
is not, as yet. seriously suffering from want 
of rain. 

The finals in the Badminton Tournament 
and Croquet handicap which were going on 
at the Mnazi Moja sports grounds during 
the whole of last week, were played off on 
Saturday last. The result of the croquet 
handicap was a win for Mrs. Dura,ud 
and Mr. Becher, the scratch couple, after a 
series of closely contested games, Mrs. 
Maokiimon and Mr. Sinclair Vicing the 
runners up. In the Badminton tourna- 
ment the 1st place, was secured by Mrs. 
Mead, Mr. Swinerd and Mr. Brown. The 
runners up, who were only one point 
behind, were Mr. Wilmott, Mr. Farre and 
Mr. Shears. 
A putting competition for ladies was also 
got up on Saturday afternoon and proved 

JLt-Kl’I IjU O, 

very popular. The prizes, which were 
presented by Mr. Baughan, were carried 
off by Mrs. Farre (first) and Mrs. Bardo 
(second). 
The playing off of the Tournament 
finals was made the occasion of a Mnozi 
Moja Club “At Home.” Thei •e was a 
large attendance of members and their 
friends and altogether the afternoon passed 
off pleasantly and successfuly. 

From a recent Parliamentary paper 
(Africa No. 15 of 1901.) we learn that the 
trade of the British East Africa Protecto- 
rate for the year ending March 31, 1901, 
amounted in the aggregate to £7(34.182’ 
compared with £848,720 for the previous 
12 months. Imports declined from £700,(360 
in 1903 to £001,3(37 in 1901, the fall being 
chiefly accounted for in imports on behalf 
of the East Africa Administration and the 
Uganda Railway, though there is a slight 
falling off in traders’ goods and specie. 
Exports on the other hand rose from 
£148,060 in 1902-03 to £159,815 in 1903-01, 
the expansion being chiefly due to increased 
deliveries of ivory, horns, hides etc.

7 Black-friars Street, 

Manchester, 

England, 

General Kuropatkin indicate that fierce 
fighting is still proceeding to the North West 
of Mukden. 

11th March. 

Reuter, Tokio: The Japanese occupied 
Mukden yesterday morning, after captur- 
ing Tila, an important position on the 
Russian left eastward of Fnshu; they are 
are vigorously pursuing the Russians. 
Reuter Tokio; Fushun was occupied last 
nigl?t. The fighting continues on the 
northern heights of Fushun; many Russian 
guns including practically all their heavy 
ordnance have been captured. Marshal 
Oyama reports that the enveloping move- 
ment practised for some days past comple- 
tely succeeded. The fiercest fighting 
continues in the vicinity of Mukden. 

13f/i March. 

Despatches from General Kuropatkin 
dated 9th March state that there were no 
serious attacks on their south and west 
fronts that day. The Japanese were con- 
centrating their attacks on the north front, 
and are continuing their northward move- 
ment. They have also occupied Kuisan 
90 versts east of Mukden. A later des- 
patch dated 10th slates that the retreat of 
all the Russia armies began last night; 
there was no fighting, but rifle and cannon 
fire lasted all night. 
A man whose passport showed that ho 
was an Englishman named MacCullough 
was blown to pieces in an hotel at St. Peters- 
burg. He was supposed to have been 
handling a bomb and to be connected with 
the revolutionaries. 
The Russians continue their retreat to 
the northward, the Japanese hanging on to 
both flanks; pouring shells on the disordered 
masses, inflicting severe losses. 
Reuter Tokio: The Japanese on Friday 
surrounded the Russians to the east and 
north of Mukden. A detachment by forced 
marching from the Hunho between Mukden 
and Fushun seized Puho thirteen miles 
north of Mukden. They are now endea- 
vouring to annihilate the remnant of the 
enemy. 
General Kuropatkin wiring 6 p.m. on the 
evening of the 11th stated: our retreat is of 
the most dangerous description, but thanks 
to extraordinary* efforts the armies are out 
of danger. 
M. Rouvier addressing the representations 
of Socialism and the radical left, declared 

that he was firmly resolved to follow the 
policy of his predecessors and govern only 
with the assistance of the majority of the 
left. If that majority failed the Cabinet 
would resign. 
M. Charcot’s French Antarctic expedition 
has returned to Argentina safely*. 
Marshal Oy*ama estimates that the Russian 
prisoners exceed -30,000. The Japanese 
casualties are 41,000. The Japanese captu- 
red a retreating Russian column at Pnbo 
on 11th inst. 
A later report from M ivshal Oyama states 
that the Russian prisoners total 40,000 and 
are increasing momentarily. The Russian, 
casualties are estimated at 90,000: they 
left 26,500 dead ou the field. 

14f/i March. 

The Times correspondent at St. Peters- 
burg telegraphs that General Kuropatkin has 
asked the Emperor’s permission to transfer 
his command owing to a need for rest. 
Official despatches record the Russian loss 
as nearly 500 guns and over 200,000 men. 
Mr. W. H. Long, President of the local 
Government Board, has been appointed to 
succeed Mr. George Wyndham as Chief 
Secretary for Ireland. Mr. Gerald Balfour, 
President of the Board of Trade will 
succeed Mr. Long. Lord Salisbury Mr. 
Gerald Balfour. The Hon. Aihvyn Fellowes 
Junior Lord of the Treasury replaces Lord 
Onslow who lias been appointed Chairman 
of Committees to the House of Lords. 
General Kuropatkin telegraphs on 11th 
inst. in the evening. “I am accompanying 
the second army*; the enemy to-day only- 
attacked the rearguard the Third Siberian 
Corps and portions of the First army at 
Smorming, fifteen or twenty* miles from 
Tiehling north of Mukden. The third 
army is on the Mandarin road 16 miles from 
Tieling: its rearguard is confronted by only 
a small force, mostly cavalry*. 47,681 
wouuded have been sent north from the 
28th February to 11th March. 
The Emperor Menelik has granted a 
charter for a State Bank to Abyssinia to 
the National Bank of Egypt supported by- 
Italian and French Financiers. 
General Karopatkin on 11th March ad- 
mits that 50,000 were wounded. 
The pursuit was continued all Sunday, 
the Russians abandoning guns and supplies 
in their wild flight. Apparently the first 
army corps is alone fairly intact; the where- 
abouts and condition of the remainder is 
quite uncertain. 

7th March, 

Marshal Oyama reports that a division 
of the enemy with 70 guns was repulsed at 
Tai-Hi-Chiao, eight miles North West of 
Mukden. The fighting is proceeding 
favourably 15 miles to the South East and 
the same distance south of Fushun, despite 
the enemy’s stubborn resistance, but the 
report does not indicate substantial progress 
anywhere. 
The battle continues to rage, exhausting 
both sides; the final issue is still hanging 
in the balance. 
The Times states the French financiers 
have intimated to Kussia that the new 
loan must not exceed .i'20,000,060 instead 
of being for ,£32,000,000, further more that 
this is the last loan raisable in Paris for 
some years. 
Beuter, with GeneralKuroki Wednesday: 
The Russians profiting by the darkness 
have evacuated all their positions along the 
Shaho and are now in full retreat after 
setting fire to huge quantities of supplies. 
The Japanese are pressing them hard. The 
fall of Mukden is imminent. 
The Temps publishes a telegram from 
Antananarivo which state that the entire 
Pmssian fleet has left Madagascar for Jibouti. 

10th March. 

A Russian telegram from ■'Mukden dated 
8th 10 a.m., states that the heavy cannonad- 
ingto the North West is shaking the houses 
at Mukden; an engagement is proceeding 
by the Imperial Tombs. 
Beuter, Tokio: It is officially announced 
that the Russians began retreating on the 
morning of the 8th; all the Japanese armies 
are vigorously pursuing them. 
The Times St. Petersburg: General 
K uropatkin reported yesterday (Wednesday) 
that the Japanese have massed an enormous 
force northward of Mukden necessitating 
his immediate retreat. The Russian losses 
during the first ten days of the battle are 
officially given as nearly 33,000 including 
830 officers. 
Reuter Tokio: The Japanese have cut 
the railway North of Mukden. 
Count Benckendorff has handed Lord 
Lansdowne .£65,000 as an indemnity for
