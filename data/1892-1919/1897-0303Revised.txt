the niger COMPANY 

expedition 

the campaign in which the niger 
any is engaged is strictly local in the field of 
its operations and it is improbable that the 
advance of the fighting column will range 
in any direction further than OF miles from 
the river the immediate cause of the 
campaign results from quarrels between the 
two different kinds of states included within 
the borders of nigeria it is the custom of 
the b ULAH emirs of the muhomedan states 
to enlarge the tributary area of their 
dominions by perpetual raiding upon their 
pagan neighbours the line traced by the 
courses of the middle niger and the 
BINGE may he taken as the limit at which 
the pagan and MAHOMETAN areas of the 
territory of the royal niger company effect 
an irregular junction to the south of this 

hue mnhomedauism has scarcely penetrated 
the regions below it ARE to the MAHOMETAN 
rulers of the border as tempting to raid AS 
were the lowlands of scotland to their 
highland neighbours human cattle of the 
most valuable kind are to he had for the 
hunting as well as varied produce of the 
fields but these human cattle who have 
fought bravely for their independence have 
had the intelligence to place themselves 
under the protection of the niger company 
it enters AS BECAUSE into the treaties 
negotiated between the company and the 
an states of the border that RAWDIN for 
slaves shall not take place in the protected 
pagan areas and that any infringement of 
this clause shall be regarded as a declaration 
of war against the company SOKOTO and 
GANDA to which these MAHOMETAN border 
states are tributary have assisted the 
ANY in its work of pacification by bringing 
pressure to bear upon the EMBRYO induce 
them to observe their treaties 
the time however has come when NUPE 
one of the most powerful of the border 
powers will no longer be constrained the 
territory of NUPE stretches westward from 
lokoja along the northern bank of the 
middle niger to the FOUSSA rapids the 
emir commands an army of about 20009 
meu and he has demonstrated his intention 
of trying issues with the company the 
company anxious to preserve the peaceful 
nature of its dominion has for five years 
endeavoured to avert hostilities aggressions 
have been overlooked everything that could 
be cone by negotiations has been done the 
efficiency of subsidies has BEEN fully tested 
the late emir was personally visited by tho 
governor and appeared for a time to be 
disposed to listen to reason hut w WITH the 
accessions of the present emir in 1895 it 
became evident that peaceful tentatives 
j were of no avail it was found that an 
intrigue had been entered into by which the 
emir of PUPIL hoped to persuade the state 
of FOUSSA and ILORIN to join with him in an 
endeavour to expel the christians from tho 
country the intrigue failed fortunately of 
its immediate object aud the company 
prepared for the first serious effort to maintain 
its authority by force of arms hitherto its 
encounters have been only with tho 
lesserpagan tribes its forces have never before 
been brought into conflict with the 
organized military power of a mahomodau state 
in may of last year the prince MOKUM or 
of the DUPO army in 
defiance of treaty agreements crossed the 

the gazette 

river to KUBA where with a force estimated 
at 1000 cavalry and 10000 infantry he 
formed a permanent camp and raiding 
centre with the result of striking panic into all 
the surrounding populations at this point 
he awaits the drying of the laud in the 
present season to carry out operations on an 
extended scale against the protected pagans 
of the south the proceeding constituted 
an act of war which left the company no 
alternative but to resist or to abdicate its 
authority the emir himself is reported 
to have joined him with a further force of 
several thousand men the camp thus 
formed SOF the nature of a town of which 
the houses are built of mud and within the 
precincts of which a large NONCOMBATANT 
population consisting of women children 
and slaves are herded together a low 
calculation would give at least two 
noncombatants for every soldier the numbers 
for whom provisions must be supplied 
AMOUNT presumably to a total not far short 
of 50000 
ft is against this unwieldy concentration 
that the little force of the royal niger 
company marched on january A the 
direction of the march would probably be due 
westward over high rising ground through 
fairly open country covered with tall dry 
grass which the troops would burn before 
them as they went their moat likely 
scheme of operations would be to endeavour 
to skirt KUBBA to the south and attack from 
the OUT and west having for their object 
to prevent a coalition between the forces 
of NUPE and florin and to drive the NUPE 
army towards the river of which the 
passage should bo held by their own flotilla 
such u scheme involves the manifest risk of 
being themselves taken between the two 
forces of DUPO and florin and will no doubt 
have been modified by the circumstances 
which they may have found awaiting them 
of these circumstances in the absence of 
direct information we can known NOTHING 
definite in this country the best grounds of 
hope which wo have for the success of so 
daring an enterprise lies in our knowledge 
of the extreme care with which the whole 
scheme has been planned and matured it 
is the custom of the MAHOMETANS to attack 
by night blue lights specially 
constructed so as to burn for ten minutes at a 
time have been taken in sufficient quantity 
to turn night if necessary into clay it is the 
custom of the MAHOMETANS to trust almost 
entirely to the efficacy of cavalry barbed 
wire wound upon reels which in their turn 
ARE mounted upon sets of wheels swift and 
easy to manipulate have been provided for 
the purpose of forming a ready obstruction 
to the onset of horsemen the white officers 
who accompany the force are in a proportion 
of not less than one to every OF men

benin and its king 

very little is known accurately of THE 
country under the rule of the king of benin i 
on the western limits of the niger 
rate as it is approached from the COAST 
the country is perfectly flat traversed HRS 
many creeks AND covered with dense forests I 

up to and beyond the capital this town 
n known to natives as BINI and 
sometimes ADD but must not be confused with 
a town about OF miles further inland marked 
on the map as ado the most important 
subordinate tribes of the neighbourhood are 
the JERIS on the creeks to the SOUTHWEST 
and the SOBS in the bush country to the 
east the MAINS consisting chiefly of an 
inoffensive fishing population lie on the 
west between the benin country and lagos 
of these tribes the JERIS are the most 
warlike and at one time under their chief nana 
they appeared likely to become the 
dominating power it was found necessary in 1894 to 
send a punitive force against nana who 
was deposed and the JERI people were 
reduced to obedience in other parts of the 
back country the policy of controlling the 
more turbulent chiefs and developing direct 
trade with the interior has been successful 
but in the benin district advance has been 
rendered impossible by the attitude of the 
king and the savage system of pagan 
theocracy of which he is the representative 
the rule of the king is of terror the 
people are brutalized by the habits of 
human sacrifices torture and cannibalism 
as a race they are reported to be indolent 
cowardly and chiefly occupied with 
agricultural pursuits and the production of palm 
oil occasionally the king of benin raids 
the SOBS for slaves the district abounds 
in rubber gum copal gum arabic tumeric 
incense gums fibres mahogany and hard 
woods under fetish rule native traders 
may not deal in gum copal and palm kernels 
the king claims half the ivory obtained in 
his dominions and declines to trade it with 
europeans keeping it to purchase soho 
slaves when the supplies are less than he 
desires he raids the JERI caravans these 
conditions naturally dispose the surrounding 
tribes to view without displeasure any 
measures which may tend to control his 
power 

mr d i bleasby a trader who has had 
OF years experience in the benin district 
and has been with three expeditions to 
benin city having had repeated messages 
from the king to visit his town again says 
that if the white men did not actually die 
in the fight which must have taken place 
when the kings men came down on the 
expedition then he has every faith in their 
safety his chiefs keep the king in 
ignorance of many things when the king 
ascends the throne of benin he goes in to 
his compound and is supposed never to leave 
it alive the king is for a negro a very 
pleasant-faced man his eyes though rather 
small have a laughing expression he has 
a short curly beard and altogether his face 
shows remarkable intelligence in stature 
he is about FT gin the portuguese in 
the old days lived in benin city and their 
presence are observable in many places 
under the auspices of the liverpool 
geographical SOCIETY a meeting was recently 
held to hear some experiences of benin 
mr james pinnock who presided said 
he had lived in sierra leone ten years 
and had had only ten days sickness the 
most powerful chief ever known in benin j 
as AMULA the late father of the deposed 
chief NAAN who had about 3000 slaves 

march A 1897 

and innumerable wives he once went on a 
visit to him and to dine with him and saw 
a large number of men all handcuffed and 
chained to a longitudinal pole running 
round the building standing about FT from 
the ground all with their ears cut off with a 
razor much as they might regret the 
recent disaster much good would result from 
it for many hundreds of human beings 
would be annually spared crucifixion AND 
torture while the country would become 
settled peaceful and prosperous mr t b 
auchterlonie who had twice visited BONINA 
read a paper on the country and its people 
as he approached benin he passed OF or OF 
dead bodies on each side of the path in all 
stages of decomposition the idea being to 
impress those approaching the town with 
the power of the king near the city the 
ground was thickly strewn with the skulls 
and bones of sacrificed human beings the 
country round was very fertile and capable 
of much cultivation but the natives did 
nothing beyond growing yams and plantains 
the climate appeared much healthier than 
at the coast it was impossible for any 
one who had not been in the country to 
realize what the natives had to put up with 
but they never showed a sign of resentment 
being in mortal terror of the men 
who were all-powerful

mr stead in the review of reviews says 
while mr rhodes is on the high seas 
hasteninghome to face the prosecution with 
which he is threatened another notable 
englishman has landed in africa where 
he will leave his mark or his corpse the 
return of sir george goldie to the niger

as that of mr rhodes is the reverse from 
his office in MOWBRAY HOUSE occupies 
the room immediately below my sanctum 
and looks out on exactly the same scene as 
as that which lies below my office windows 
sir george goldie has brooded for years 
over the work which he is now in the field 
preparing to accomplish in the last 
conversation i had with him immediately before 
his departure he spoke with deep 
earnestness of the perilous quest on which he was 
starting a quiet man who has set his heart 
on delivering forty million human beings 
from an infernal slave trade ho made no 
secret of the arduous nature of the task on 
which he was about to embark his fortunes 
and those of the niger company we 
have done much he said of which 
fortunately nothing has been heard it is possible 
to lay the foundations of empire without 
being disturbed where the climate is too 
deadly for newspaper correspondents to live 
i now go to complete the work we shall 
put it through but make no mistake we 
are putting our fortune to the touch to win 
or lose it all i heartily hope he will win 
it all but it is a dangerous business and 
we cannot afford to lose either the niger or 
its uncrowned king

USEFUL handling and will tax the energies 
of south african politicians for many rears

mr henry cust in an article published in

dropping the chartered toimnittee and 
declares that south africa except pretoria 
is wholly against it 

the dark continent it will he seen 
occupies more than its fair share of the 
attention of the world and especially of 
england this is but natural for as sir 
h h JOHNSTON has just reminded us the 
briton has played the leading role in the 
exploration and development of africa the 
following passages from his address are well 
worthy of being borne in mind 
all the great rivers and lakes of africa 
have been mode known to tho world mainly 
by the exploration of british subjects 
englishman irishmen scotchmenor 
men first discovered and made an actual 
fact the existence and approximate 
dimensions of most of the african lakes the 
name of LIVINGSTONE is indissolubly 
connected with the mapping of the ZAMBESI from 
its source to its mouth other englishmen 
first explored and mapped most of the 
can rivers mungo park is acknowledged 
by all men to have been the first to place 
the niger river accurately on the map 
stanley is the hero of the congo regards 
the nile and its systems what geographical 
work done by other europeans can be 
compared with the researches of HUGE 
rick baker SPEKE and grant who were 
the first to turn the alfa grass of north 
africa to the practical use of making paper 
englishmen who first created palm-oil 
as a trade product now being sold annually 
for millions of pounds englishmen it 
was englishmen like sir john KIRK sir 
alfred MALONEY and others who started or 
developed the trade in rubber and gums on 
the east and west coasts of africa 
men first of all have developed the 
cultivation of cotton in the ZAMBESI countries 
and in egypt and indigo on the niger 
who first discovered diamonds and gold 
englishmen and the nitrates which it is 
hoped may yet add to the exports of egypt 
an englishmen mr eloycr who first 
stimulated the cultivation of the GROUNDNUT 
in the gambia which now produces nearly 
all our finest olive oil quietly manufactured 
at marseilles englishmen who 
introduced the tea plant into natal and created 

mr henry cust late editor of tho RAIL 
mall gazette formerly m p for STAMFORD 
division of lincnolshire in the course of an 
interesting conversation with REUTERS agent 
gave it as his opinion as a result of careful 
observation and close contact with leading 
men that there had been a steady revulsion 
of feeling in mr RHODES favour for some 
time past amongst the dutch of the cape 
colony apart from the return of their 
former admiration of mr rhodes he thought 
that the sympathies of liquor producers of the 
cape had been alienated from the transvaal 
owing in a great measure to the MATTERS 
recently-introduced liquor law with 
regard to theenglish parliamentary enquiry 
into the chartered affairs ho was strongly 
of opinion that the cape enquiry had done 
all that was necessary and had located the 
blame for the raid and no good purpose 
could be served by going on with the house 
of commons inquiry with the exception 
chiefly of pretoria he found that the people 
were apathetic on the subject and felt that 
if the enquiry were dropped it would be 
merely a nine days wonder president 
KRUGER however he found very 
unrelenting and keenly anxious that mr rhodes 
should he punished in the event of the 
commons inquiry being proceeded with 
mr cust expressed his willingness to give 
evidence having in tho course of his travels 
become possessed of information which 
could not fail to have bearing on the result 
of the committees work with respect to 
the uitlander question in the transvaal mr 
cust thinks that a modus vivendi might be 
found by the raad granting just what is 
necessary for johannesburg existence 
without conceding the uitlanders full 
DEMANDS SORT a policy of mutual 
concession mr cust however emphasised the 
fact that the view of the tjitlander living 
on the spot and hampered in his work and 
life is necessarily more urgent than that of a 
home politician and he is firmly convinced 
that radical changes and ruptures will ensue 
on the death of president KRUGER whose 
strong personality alone keeps things as

following details of the 

loss of the TROOPSHIP warren 

hastings at reunion 

the djemnah which arrived here 
from reunion on the WITH inst brought 
the news of tho loss of tho above transport 
with the WITH rifles aboard on tho WITH 
on the rocks off st PHILLIPE reunion while 
on her voyage from bombay and the cape 
to this fortunately only two lives were 
lost although the troops were not got ashore 
without difficulty the major portion of the 
shipwrecked soldiers landing by a lino from 
the FOREPART of the vessel it seems the 
warren hastings struck in water 
sufficiently deep to permit of her running up 
close to the land the b i cos steamer 
lolpoora happened fortunately to be 
at reunion when the accident happened 
and she brought over the troops here on 
the WITH in good health but 
greatlyrequiring rest after the danger and 
excitement they had passed THROUGHOUT late 
governor sir h jerningham who 
happened to be at reunion eu route to england 
on the loth january at once left for 
PHILLIPE with his usual energy in order to 
endeavour to be of use the wreck occurred 
at about A am ANTI the landing began 
in perfect order as soon as it was light two 
natives who leaped OVERBOARD through fear 
lost their lives and about a dozen persons 
were injured and were received with great

had formerly 
small constructions which 
been labourers quarters on an 
abandoned RIMER STATE were available and 
these were at once handed over to captain 
holland who lodged the soldiers in them 
these sleeping in their wet clothes before 
FIRE huh they lighted CARTLOADS of 
provisions were sent to the wrecked people 
by the french authorities who showed 
consideration and kindness 
ne nows o the wrecked vessel touched 
a jetty nt ft PHILLIPE and the steamer is 
now lying over on her side completely 
lost all the passengers and crew were very 
much touched by the kindness of the 
bon people 
the captain of the vessel believed that 
he was A miles from land at the moment of 
the wreck which is attributed to the 
currents on the previous day it had rained 
and he was unable to get his bearings 
after all had got ashore some 
UNSUCCESSFUL efforts were made to land some valuables 
and baggagethe cause being that the 
sea rose and prevented communication 
the troops are quite enthusiastic on the 
score of the kindness extended to them by 
the french authorities and colonists and 
they did not fail to show their appreciation of 
this on any occasion which presented itself 
as the bi str lalpoora was leaving 
union with the troops she passed the str of 
themessageries co bjemnah lying off the 
pointe des COLLETIA bugle was sounded 
and the band of the SHIPWRECKED soldiers 
struck up the marseillaise whilst hundreds 
of soldiers climbed the rigging and cheered

lowered its flag thrice in acknowledgment

number of carpenters and sailors onboard to 
endeavour to effect salvage the steamer

groat deal of regimental plate and 
some VALUABLE private jewellery belonging to

the plague in 

caused HEHE 

we have had some sensational meetings 
here caused by the fears of a section of the 
inhabitants who were under a good deal of 
excitement caused by recent events in 
bay it was endeavoured to get a law passed 
rendering it optional for the sanitary 
authorities to prohibit the landing of all goods 
from india including rice our position 
here is an exceptional one mauritius 
producing no food supplies and the effect of such 
legislation would be to send up prices of food 
in THE island to famine rates a special 
session of the legislative council was 
held to consider the MATTERED fortunately 
the cooler-headed portion of our community 
able to carry the day after a statement 
from the officer administering tho 
mem to the effect that our stock of rice was 
barely equal to a month and a halfs j 
sumption and that the law if passed would 
render famine here imminent a MAJORITY 
of our legislators then voted against legal 
power being given to the sanitary body to 
prevent food being landed in the island

n m s PHOEBE and 

the firing on british ships 

news received at liverpool shows that 
her MAJESTY ship PRICE has made an 
inquiry into the firing on british ships by 
the liberian gunboats the phoebe took 
down colonel CARDEW governor of siena 
leone to monrovia the capital of liberia 
the liberians alleged that the steamers 
violated regulations of the country the 
captains of the steamers on their part 
alleged that tho laws and regulations were so 
often changed that even the liberian naval 
officials did not seem to agree as to 
whatthey really were the captains further 
alleged that when they were approaching a 
port of entry they had been prevented from 
communicating with the shore or were tired 
on the liberians were held to be in the 
wrong in first firing a shot at the vessels 
and this practice has been stopped the 
steamers on their part are only to go to ports 
of ENTRY strange to say the steamer LOANDA 
which arrived off cape PALMAS on the WITH 
ult could not obtain communication with 
the shore she had a large number of 
krooboy passengers for ROCKTON and other 
places not ports of entry she called at capo 
PALMAS the port of entry next to rocktowb 
to arrange about the customs duty so that 

she might getpermission to call at the 
various ports she RETURNED off the port till 
the next morning the liberian not taking 
the slightest notice of her signals the 
cmtntn then loft and landed his passengers 
at ROCKTON

the future of south africamrw 
f bailey writes an article in the national 
review on the native problem in south 
africa he sums up as follows 
the genera conclusion may be drawn that 
south africa as a whole will never be a 
white mans country in the same SCUFT as ARE 
the united STATES americacanada 
LIA or new zealand the hulk of the labour of 
the community will not fall on the 
an inhabitants the country will afford no 
outlet for the teeming labouring populations 
of england or the continent skilled 
labourers and artisans will doubtless find 
employment there but the pick-and 
man had best keep out of the country it 
will rather resemble india and ceylon than 
australia and new zealand europeans 
will always find in it an outlet for their 
energies an opening for the employment of 
their capital and an opportunity for adding 
to their wealth its climate is FARMERS suitable 
for them than that of india and were south 
africa without its native races it might have 
a career like unto that of victoria or new 
south wales colorado or california but 
we must judge of the future of the country 
by the tendencies that environ it and its 
destiny is limited and controlled by racial 
conditions from which there is no escape

oil castorhas decidedly improved 
this week the quotations for french oil 
having now recovered a considerable portion 
of the decline that occurred towards the end 
of last year the french government are 
about to prohibit the landing of all 
merchandise coming from plague-infected 
localities and as the marseilles oil mills 
practically depend upon the supply of east indian I 
seed it is not improbable that several of 
them may have to close for want of raw 
material the present prices of french 
castor oil on the spot very a good dealviz

it is said that not only are tho present stocks 
of castor seed and oil in india extremely 
small and difficult to get to the shipping 
ports on account of the interruption caused 
to business by the plague but the plants 
are described as having suffered much from 
last years drought and the prospects 
of the crop are extremely poor it

the opinion and the facts 

first let AS have what the doctor said then the 
facts upon which he based his opinion and 
finally we may ask whether the facts justified 
that opinion 
the doctors opinion was this the man is 
suffering from chronic inflammation of the brain 
the facts as set forth subsequently by the 
PATIENT HIMSELF under oath and also verified by 
careful investigation are these 
lu august 1880 the first symptoms of disease 
appeared he had a bad taste in the mouth and 
a thick slimy phlegm covered the tongue and 
teeth so that he was often obliged to wipe it out 
with a handkerchief he had no appetite and 
after eating the simplest thing lie felt great 
oppression and pains at the sides and chest 
later on he was seized with dizziness and 
dreadful pain in the head the back of the head being 
swollen and so hot that it seemed on fire 
this PAIN in the head grew worse until the 
patient fancied his head must hurst and as it 
was he nearly went out of his mind with the 
agony of it he got little or no sleep night or 
day and as he could take practically no 
nourishmentthat is nothing at all equal to the needs 
of the BODY gradually fell away until there 
was scarcely anything left of him but skin and 
brine after a time a hacking cough fixed upon 
him and he constantly spat up much matter 
a t this point his malady had some of the 
indications of consumption 
for a considerable time mr manning the 
patients name was confined to his bed and for 
nearly a DEAR was unable to leave the house as

some three months in zanzibar on his way

reply to a deputation from the society of 
one year said that mr manning had chronic

inflammation of the brain and recommended the 
results of granting compensation to the west 
application of poultices and fomentations to the 
indian slave holders and the continuation 
head 
of slavery under the name of 
after having been under the doctors 
treatment for a year says mr manning i was 
ship by the same writer filling twelve 
no better and he said he could do nothing more 
pages deserves thoughtful study and is 
for me I then had another doctor who said my 
commended by the author to the attention 
case was hopeless mid nothing could be done for 
of the PROSLAVERY officials of zanzibar 
me our rectors daughter got me several bottles 
we are not aware such exist wo suppose 
of medicine for consumption from london but 
the FESTINA lento advocating members of 
OFFICE did no good and i lingered on in the same 
COAL life here were those really meant the 
state year after year i was in such pain that 
distinction is not without difference 
i often wished it might be gods will to take me 
several times it was reported that i teas actually 
dying 
in november 1892 mrs franklin WIFE tho 
coin merchant gave me a bottle of medicine 
which she hoped might do me good it was 
called SEIDELS syrup i had no faith in it but i 
began taking it in a week i felt a little better 
my head was easier i had some relish for food 
and what i ate agreed with me so i kept on 
with it and gained a little every day from that 
time i never looked behind me and soon gained 
two stone in weight i am now quite strong and 
am bank to my work i can eat any kind of food 
and am free from all pain but for this medicine 
SOIREES syrup i believe i should be in my 
grave and so great is my desire that others may 
know of the remedy that saved my life i give full 
permission to the proprietors to publish my case 
if they think best to do so 
the above statement is condensed from the 
more extended legal one in order to save space 
the other however will soon he published in full 
in another form this is signed by mr henry 
delph manning of A high street HILLY near 
downham norfolk and has appended 
confirmatory statements from WITNESSES of high standing 
now we ask was the doctor right in thinking 
the case to have been one of cerebral 
inflammation no clearly not as that nearly always 
arises from a severe injury to the brain and is 
usually fatal in a short time the head trouble 
in this case was congestion of the brain resulting 
from acute indigestion and dyspepsia mr 
KINGS true and only disease when mother 
SEIDELS curative syrup cured that the brain and 
other disordered organs recovered health and 
tone
