H. II. S. Crescent, 1st class cruiser. Cap- 
tain T. b. W. Napier, M. v. o. flying the 
Him o£ Hear Admiral John Durnford, c.B. 
arrived on Saturday morning saluting the 
Sultan’s flag as she came to her anchorage. 
The Crescent encountered heavy weather 
in the Mozambique channel, was hove to 
|,„. |ij hours, and had two boats smashed. 
Professor C. Nhlig of the Imperial Go- 
vernment Service, Dar es Salaam, arrived 
from Tanga by the Reichstag leaving ogam 
for Dar es Salaam on Saturday. Professor 
I hlig is engaged in Meteorological and 
Geographical research and has assisted in 
organizing the Meteorological stations m 
G^E. A. and their records upon a very 
complete system. The unusually heavy 
rains of January, to which we drew atten- 
tion a fortnight ago, seem to have been 
shared on the German Coast but the rainfall 
for Mombasa was only 1*1! inches for that 
month. 

Mr. J. T. Murray of Messrs. Ewart 
Thompson & Co., arrived by the Reichstag 
from Bombay. We are g'lud to he able to 
welcome back in him an old friend to Zan- 
zibar. Mr. Murray relieved Mr. W. M. 
.Ross who left for England by the I rench 
mail yesterday. 

The gloom of tho week accentuated by 
the roar of the guns of the Squadron at 
practice, culminated this morning in a 
violent burst ot rain from the south-west. 
In fact what with the thunder of cannon 
and the crash of Heaven’s batteries, fright- 
ed folk would have had little difficulty this 
morning in imagining themselves in a be- 
sieged city. Ever a fruitful topic of dis- 
cuiSion, weather in Zanzibar provides us 
with many surprises, not always delightful. 
Bince the turn of the year we have been 
asking one another:—why all this rain now; 
when is the north-east monsoon going to 
blow? Unanswered, these questions will 
soon give way to the more serious one 
of the masika which we may expect within 
a few weeks. 

After enjoying the luxury of fresh butter 
for 3 weeks, Zanzibar has been compelled 
to return again to her tins. This is due 
we understand to representations that the 
Govern incut farm at Naivasha was en- 
gaging in unfair competition with the 
settlers of Nairobi. While we entirely 
concur in the principal here involved we 
venture to point out that in sending fresh 
butter to Zanzibar the Government were 
not competing with the settlers. The 
settlers cannot supply us, and from what 
we can learn there is no prospect of their 
doing so yet. 

Whether the market of Zanzibar is worth 
securing, with the aid of Government pro- 
duce or without it, is a question that con- 
cerns Nairobi, but as we cannot get fresh 
butter from Nairobi we see no reason why 
w e should not endeavour to obtain it from 
JHirban. We are served with two lines of 
mail steamers equipped with refrigerators.

10U lbs a mouth cvould supply our needs at 
present but the market if properly supplied 
would we feel sure prove to be a rapidly 
expanding one. 

“Cloves, which promised great things at 
the end of the week, have somewhat de- 
teriorated again, and have disappointed 
their supporters. But, like Shellac, Cloves 
are full ot possibilities, and another surprise 
may he sprung upon us at any moment. 
Its movements are watched with intense 
interest by all engaged in the article. 
Chillies—An enquiry for Zanzibar 
growth has sprung up, and sales to a good 
extent have been made at 3'Is. (id. up to 
35s. per cwt., closing at the latter, for fair 
quality, which exhibits an advance.” Lon- 
don Commercial Record. 

A sad accident occurred on Sunday even- 
ing. Stoker B. Smithers of H. M. S. 
Crescent was returning to his ship but not 
being familiar with the geography of 
Shangani he arrived at the Consular pier 
instead of the usual lauding steps. Finding 
no shore boats there, and seeing a boat at 
anchor a little distance off he started to 
swim out to her but was taken down with 
the weight of his clothes and never rose 
again to the surface. His body was reco- 
vered at about 10 o'clock in the evening. 
Deceased was buried at Grave Island on 
Monday afternoon with full naval honours. 
The Baran-a sails this evening taking 
back to Mombasa the labourers that came 
down for clove picking, Numbers also of 
those that came from Pemba are returning. 
These recruits have been a welcome addi- 
tion to our labour supply in the season 
which has now closed, and have helped out 
many an Arab with his crop. 

Judge Murison has had a large number 
of cases recently of driving horses unfit to 
be driven. Indians are almost always the 
offenders. The two latest cases were 
against Sivji Jamnadass and Abdulla bin 
Monyene. In the former of theses cases 
it appeared that the horse had seven sores, 
that the sycc- remonstrated with his master 
while the horse was being harnessed, and 
that the accused was warned only a few 
months ago about the same offence in con- 
nection with the same horse. He was fined 
Es. 50 in addition to the cost of keeping 
the animal in the Government stables un- 
til it was fit. The second case was of a 
milder nature. The accused was fined 
Rs. 10 and the cost of keeping the horse in 
the Government stables till fit. 
One of the worst criminals in Zanzibar, 
by name Aboo Davood, has just been sen- 
tenced to deportation by Judge Murison. 
The sentence has been approved by H. M. 
Agent and Consul-General. The list of 
the criminal's offences and sentences is as 
follows:— 
25th August, 1902. Three months’ ri- 
gorous imprisonment for theft. 
22nd October, 1904. One year’s rigo- 
rous imprisonment for being in possession 
of stolen property. 
17th January, 1906. Nine months’ ri- i 
gorous imprisonment for being in possession 

February 28, 1906. 

of stolen property. 0 
20th January, 1900. Three months’ V 
rigorous imprisonment for being ia posses- 
sion of stolen property. Sentence to run 
from expiration of previous sentence. 
24th January, 1906. Six months’ rigo- 
rous imprisonment for theft. Sentence to 
run from expiration of previous sentence. 
Before these sentences Aboo Davood 
bad been convicted of assaulting his master 
and also of rioting.

Teal are now at Kiu Kiang. 
There was some progress at the Algeciras 
Conference on Tuesday, and the feeling is 
more hopeful. 
A Convention dated 6th December is 
published, by which France undertakes to 
lay a cable from Mauritius to Reunion 
within two years. France maintains the 
cable and receives the rates apart from a 
rate not exceeding 20 centimes per word 
which the Mauritius Government receives 
for the maintenance and working of the 
land line to the Terminus in Mauritius. 
2nd March. 

The Naval estimates amount to £31,250,000 
a decrease of £1,500,000. The item 
for new constructions shows a decrease of 
£250,000 on last years’ estimates. The 
new ships to b3 laid down this and next 
year are four armoured vessels the designs 
of which are not settled yet, twelve sub- 
marines, five ocean torpedoe vessels and 
twelve for coastal work. 
The Prince and Princess of Wales’ tour 
is now officially complete, and has been 
politically most gratifying. There have 
been marked and continual demonstration 
of affectionate loyalty both from the chiefs 
and people, while the Prince’s intercourse 
with the chiefs has everywhere produced 
the happiest impressions. 
The Chinese Government has ordered 
severe punishment of the participators in 
the Nanchang outrage, and declares that it 
is willing to make reasonable reparation. 
The French Chamber by 344 to 174 votes 

has agreed to reduce the annual training of 
Reservists and Territorial troops to 15 and 
6 days respectively, in spite of the strenu- 
ous opposition of M. Rouvier who declined 
to be a party to the weakening of the 
vital forces of the country. 
There is a correction in the British Navy 
estimates. It should be torpedoe boat 
destroyers, not torpedoe boats. 
Altogether a more hopeful feeling pre- 
vails at Algeciras, though the Conference 
does not progress. It is understood that 
various influences are working to draw 
Germany and France together notably that 
01 the Tsar. 
The King meets fhe Kaiser shortly, 
probably aboard ship. 
The Anglo-French convention has been 
signed settling the differences with refe- 
rence to the New Hebrides. 
Mr. Robertson stated ia the House that 
the naval estimates, for which the late 
Government were essentially responsible, 
might be regarded as a reversion to the 
two Power standard. 

'drd March. 

It is stated in Washington that the War 
Department is prepared to despatch 25,000 
troops to China at a day's notice. 
Lord Selbourne speaking at the Cambrian 
Society’s Banquet at Johannesburg alluded 
to the Boers as partners with the British,

John Burns said the Government would 
endeavour to secure the passage of the Bill 
this Session. 

5th March. 

The King embarked on the Royal Yacht

Tho Algeciras Conference has adopted a 
Bank scheme drafted by the Committee 
being a sort of compromise of the French 
German, and "Morocco schemes but it is 
incomplete, several important points 
being reserved for further discussion. 
Sir Arthur Nicolson proposed to tho 
Conference to consider the police question 
in Committee on Monday, while the Bank 
scheme was officially before the Conference. 
Germany, Austria and Morocco voted against; 
this. Eventually.the Conference agreed to 
Sir A. Nicolson’s proposals. 
A disastrous tornado visited the Society 
Islands on the 7 February; whole settlements

H. M. S. Crescent left for Mombasa on 
Thursday morning, the Forte returning to

Archdeacon (Anion writes from Mnsasi; 
Feb. 12. “The journey from Lindi was a 
rough one. We left Lindi on 5th with an 
escort of 10 asknris and 20 WTinyamwezi. 
about o0 of our mission people from Masnsi 
and as many from other places, with a very 
large number of up country people who had 
been waiting for the opportunity. 
Air. Eworbeck (the Governor) addressed 
the escort before leaving, giving them 
many instructions as to my safe conduct. 
Very faithfully they carried them out. Tired 
as they must have been with the day’s 
marches °n no account would they omit 
sentry duty at night. On Monday we 
camped at Ruaha (about 5 hours from 
Lindi) no incident by the way. Next day 
we reached Mtua : here we saw what des 
truction the enemy had wrought on the 
properly of every one who was in any way 
connected with the European. 
Wednesday at Nangao (the Benedictine 
head quarters). terrible havoc, the beauti- 
ful brick church a heap of rubbish, part of 
the East wall broken down; altar alone left, 
part too of the W. wall with the date 1900 
still legible. The large new house for the 
community which was finished last year is 
now a heap of ruins and many other brick 
buildings lately completed have all shared 
the same fate. 
The Sisters’ 1 ig bouse which had an 
iron roof is now the Only building standing, 
the enemy being unable to destroy it 
though they did all the damage to it that 
they could. 
Thursday wo left at 3 a. m. for a long 
march, as the journey was through a district 
which the authorities were a bit anxious 
about; the paths were bad beyond descrip- 
tion. No houses are standing on the road, 
the loyal houses were burnt by the enemy, 
and the punitive expedition brought down 
the rest. 
Fiiday we parsed a place where a big 
fight had taken place of which we saw 
gruesome remains- The chief of the place 
was a big rebel leader and we met him 
being taken in chains by a guard to Lindi. 
Four hours marching brought us into a 
better state of erder and soon our own 
(Christian) people began to come up greeting 
me. 
The Shamha looked flourishing; such a 
relief to the eye after the four days desola- 
tion. Next four hours very slow, as the 
people pressed up from the village all 
round seemingly pleased to welcome me 
back.—The small school at Masasi had not 
been destroyed am! is used as a church, as 
many as could get into it joining in Thanks- 
giving for all God’s goodness to us on the 
journey.—Masasi is a perfectly' heart 
breaking sight. It is nothing but ruins of 
what was a few months ago. 
Fortunately an old house (store room) 
was left, and dues duty for school, where 
teaching work has gone on as far ns circum- 
stances allowed all through the trouble.

somewhat chary to adopt the initiative and 
go ahead once more. It seems a waiting

DEATH O F 

Mr. ALEXANDER. 
Zanzibar was profoundly moved 
this morning by the news of the 
death of Mr. Alexander, Treasurer 
of the Zanzibar Government. So 
recently as last Wednesday, February 
28, Mr. Alexander was at work in 
his office at the Treasury but at noon 
he went home and took to his bed. 
On Monday the doctors decided that 
an operation was necessary and this 
was accordingly performed that 
afternoon with great relief to the 
patient. Until Tuesday evening his 
condition was satisfactory but late 
that night signs of heart failure began 
to manifest themselves and death 
occurred suddenly this morning at 
half past six. 
It is scarcely necessary for us to 
say that the deepest sympathy is felt 
by all classes in Zanzibar for Mrs. 
Alexander in her great s n-row. 
Esteemed all who knew him, more 
especially by those who had the privi- 
lege of his friendship, among whom 
his high spirits, genial presence and 
manners made him ever a welcome 
companion or guest, Mr. Alexander 
is mourned to-day by all Zanzibar. In 
his death the Zanzibar Government, 
loses a valued servant; his brother 
officials a beloved colleague. 

THE FUNERAL. 

Fragrant with the perfume of floral 
tributes that surrounded it, the coffin, 
draped with the Union Jack and 
bearing the helmet and sword of the 
deceased officer, rested in the hall of 
his house whither gathered this after- 
noon those who were to follow him 
to his last resting place. The Service 
was conducted by the Rt. Rev. the 
Bishop of Zanzibar assisted by the 
Yen. Archdeacon Evans. At a quar- 
ter to five Archdeacon Evans began 
the Service and at the close of St. 
Paul’s beautiful chapter to Corin- 
thians the procession was formed for 
the cemetery. The procession was 
headed by His Highness the Sultan’s 
Goanese band, followed by a firing 
party of II H’s. troops and a detach- 
ment of troops drawing a gun car- 
riage with the coffin upon it. Ten 
of the deceased officer’s colleagues in 
the Government acted as pall bearers, 
namely, Mr. E. K. May, Dr. L. A. 
Andrade, Captain F. S. Bardo, Mr. 
J. T. Last, Captain Goldie Taubman,

D. O. A. L., Mr. W. Robinson and 
staff of the E. T. C. Mr. J. Whitlark, 
the servants of the deceased, and 
many residents from the town. Ma- 
jor C. E. Bagnall was, to his regret, 
unable to attend. 
To the strain of Handels’ Dead 
March in Saul, the troops with re- 
versed arms, the corter/c slowly filed 
out of the narrow streets into the 
broad thoroughfare of the Mnazi 
Mmoja to the English cemetery. 
The line of route was thronged with 
spectators and. a large crowd followed 
behind ; but perfect order prevailed. 
As the coffin passed the barracks the 
guard presented arms. The ceme- 
tery reached, the Bishop resumed the 
service at the grave side while all 
gathered round to share in the last 
sacred rite. The coffin, which was 
of polished teak, bore a plate with 
the inscription ; 

Alexander Alexander, 

Born Feb:)-: 22ml 1SG-2, 
Died March 7til 1903. 

Toe spirit shaal return- into god nno gave it. 

n. i. r. 

At the conclusion of the service 
the troops tired three volleys over 
the grave, the last post sounded and 
then nothing remained but for each 
one to throw upon the coffin his 
handful of soil. 
Weep bitterly over the dead, as he is 
worthy, and then comfort thyself; drive 
heaviness away: thou shall not do him 
b'ood, but hurt thyself.—Ecclesiastieus 
xxxviu. Mathew Arnold. 

The wreaths and crosses, which 
were arranged over the grave, were 
in great variety and number and 
bore testimony of the affection and 
regard in which Mr. Alexander was 
held in Zanzibar. Those with cards 
attached included the following, but 
there were many others without 
cards: The Zanzibar Government 
(an anchor), Treasury staff, staff of 
the Agricultural Department, B. and 
M. Cave, General and Mrs. Raikes, 
Mr. and Mrs. Yergos, Mr, and Mrs.R. 
N. Talati, Capt.aud Mrs. Bardo, M. ,v

Mr. Alexander first came out to 
Africa in 1801, joining the I.B.E.A. 
Company on July 2, of that year. 
In 1894, just before the Cimpany 
handed over the Administration of 
their territories to the British Gov- 
ernment, lie accepted an engagement 
from the firm of Messrs. =Smith 
Mackenzie A Co., and became their 
manager at Mombasa. But for this 
he would in all probability have 
joined the service of the British 
Government as so many other of the 
Company’s officials did. On March 1, 
1897,he was appointed, by the late Sir 
Lloyd Mathews, Assistant Treasurer 
to the Zanzibar Government and on 
Jau.l, 1900, Treasurer. During the 
absence of Sir Lloyd Mathews in 
England on leave from February 27 
to November 27, 1900, he acted ns 
First Minister of the Zanzibar Gov- 
ernment. 

In 1897, Mr. Alexander received 
from the late Seyyid Hamoud the 
4th class of the Order of Hamoudieh; 
in 1902 the Imperial British East 
Africa service medal; in June, 1903, 
the second class of the Order of 
Saidieh from His Highness Seyyid 
Ali bin Hamoud; and i-i July, 1905, 
the distinction ot Chevalier do TOrdre 
de Notre Dame de Villa Vijosa from 
His August Majesty the King of 
Portugal.

RgntgPs Crftijrunm. 

Sth March. 

King Edward got a most enthusiastic 
send ofi in Paris on his way to Biarritz and 
King Alfonso, Princess Ena and her mother 
to San Sebastian. 
The Army Estimates amount to .£'29,796, 
000 a decrease of £17,000 in spite of an 
increase of £220,000 for the reserves which 
are expected to reach to 122,000 men, and 
£290,000 for stores and clothing. The Esti- 
mates practically simply provide for the 
carrying on of the Army on its present 
footing. 
In the French Chamber, discussing the 
Naval estimates, M. Lockroy was cheered 
for a speech declaring that the Naval pro- 
gramme was inadequate, and pointing out 
the importance of the Navy in event of a 
war with Germany. 

King Edward has arrived at Biarritz. 
The preliminary rites of Princess Ena’s 
conversion were performed at San Sebastian 
yesterday. The Pope sent the Princess 
rich presents accompanied by an autograph 
letter. The conversion was completed in 
the chapel of the Miramar Palace of San 
Sahastian in the presence of the Spanish 
Royal Family and the Premier. 
Navy Estimates. Mr. Robertson stated 
that only 3 cruisers would be laid down 
this year instead of the 4 proposed in last 
year’s programme. 
Mr. Haldane announced that flogging in 
the Army would henceforth he totally 
abolished. 

9f/i March. 

During the Debate in the Chamber on 
the manner in w’hich the taking of the 
Church inventories had been carried out. 
the Government were defeated by 2G7 to 
234 votes. The Cabinet has resigned. 
There is a more conciliatory feeling at 
Algeciras where it is believed that Germany 
is disposed to accept a Franco-Spanish 
policing. 
5- The resignation of the French Cabinet 
arose through a riotous scene at the Church 
of Boeschepe in the Department of the Nord, 
where shots were exchanged during the 
taking of the inventory and a man was 
rilled. 
Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman announced 
:hat a committee pooceeds to South Africa 
■0 inquire into the basis of the Transvaal 

Constitution. 
Mr. Haldane in explaining the Army 
estimates said they have to face automatic 
increases to extent of £600.000 but in nine 
weeks, the Army Council and Generals had 
effected economies to the extent of £800,000 
and in nowise diminishing the fighting 
efficiency of the Army. 

10th March. 

The Austrian Delegate to the Algeeiras 
Conference has submitted a scheme fur a 
Franco-Spanish policing with a Swiss or 
Dutch Inspector-General. Herr Rudowitz 
has accepted Franco-Spanish policing if un- 
der International surveillance, and said that 
Macedonia and China proved the advantages 
of a joint European control M. Reosil said 
that France was prepared to give fresh 
guarantees of commercial equality if the 
Conference agreed to Franco-Spanish poli- 
cing. 
France regards a Dutch or Swiss Inspec- 
tor-General as a complication and nnacce.pt- 
able, hut everything points to satisfactory 
compromises on the main points. 
Manila. After three days fighting some 
American troops and sailors with the 
Phillipine constabulary exterminated 600 
outlaws who were holding a steep fortified 
mountain near Tolo. all were killed. The 
artillery was raised 300 feet by block and 
tackle. The attacking force lost IS killed 
and 52 wounded. 
M. Fallieres has asked M. Sarrien to form 
a ministry, the latter is consulting with his 
friends. 
Princess Ena and  her mother have left 
San Sebastian, homeward hound.

M. Thomson announced that it was propos- 
ed to build six 18000 ton battleships of a 
speed of 18 knots. It was not considered 
that experience yet warranted the use of 
Turbines. 
M. Sarrien’s Cabinet is progressing satis- 
factorily in the making. 
The priests in charge of three Paris 
Churches have been committed for trial by 
the correctkvial tribunal charged with com- 
plicity in acts of violence. 
The Courtier ex catastrophe is without 
parallel in the history of mining. 1219 have 
been killed. A crowd of 25000 persons 
struggled at the pitheads endeavouring to 
learn the fate of their breadwinners. It 
appears that the fire had been smouldering 
for days in the lower workings, and broke 
out furiously on Saturday morning, 700 
feet below the surface; resulting in the ex- 
plosions of firedamp. The work of rescue 
is of the most difficult and dangerous nature, 
the galleries are caving in and are full of 
poisonous gases. Hundreds of bodies have 
been recovered. 
The subscriptions for the sufferers are 
coming in freely. The Chamber will be 
asked to vote 500,000 francs. 
A section of the Ministerealists are dis- 
appointed that there is no reduction in our 
Army' estimates. 

13f/i March. 

Their Majesties the King and Queen of 
Portugal were to arrive at Madrid yester- 
day on a visit to King Alfonso of Spain. 
The Royal Marriage was to be formally 
announced in the Cortes yesterday, when 
the Government proposes to fix the future 
Spanish Queen's allowance at £10,000 per 
annum. 
Manuel Quintana, President of the French 
Republic is dead. 
Warnings have come from French and 
German sources at Algeciras that there are 
still considerable difficulties to be overcome. 
M. Sarrien xvill probably take the post of 
Minister of Justice in the New French 
Cabinet. M. Clemeneeau that of Minister of 
the Interior. 
The French Chamber has unanimously 
voted £20,000 for the relief of the sufferers 
by the Courrieres Mine disaster. The roll call 
shows that the victims amount to L150, only 
90 bodies have been recovered, further 
operations have been stopped owing to the 
accumulations of fire damp, and the stench 
arising from the bodies.
