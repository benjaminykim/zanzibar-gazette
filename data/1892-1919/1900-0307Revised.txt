the war and its lessons 

how many boers are there 

following the general considerations 
dealt with under the above heading writes 
c f t in the african BESEW and 
accepting the quoted conclusion of an 
eminent military authority that we have 
entered upon a wholly new era in military 
tactics it is necessary to obtain a reliable 
estimate of the strength of the boer army 
before proceeding further a vast amount 
of ingenious speculation has been wasted 
upon estimates of the numbers opposed to 
us such totals as 80000 and even 100000 
boers are seriously put forward by prints 
having some claims to the attention of the 
public the compilers seem to be incapable 
of dealing with the known facts which are 
at the disposal of everyone who has a real 
desire to arrive at the truth if a reverse 
takes place account for it by doubling 
previous estimates seems to be the rule 
followed alike by military experts on this side and 
correspondents at the front thus when 
the LADYSMITH check took place a 
prominent military writer immediately rushed up 
the totals of the commandoes engaged to 
35000 men though the estimate of the man 
on the SPOTS george WHITEWASH OF 
000 and it has been over since 
the cape times which no doubt 
demonstrated by statistics any number of times 
before the war that there ARE not more than 
35000 burghers now gravely cables that it 
has reliable estimates proving that there are 
87000 men in the field against us is it 
necessary to repeat that it is far better for 
englishmen to got at the truth even at the 
expense of a little loss of self-esteem than 
to blind ourselves with false CONCEPTION of 
the strength and power of our foes 
obviously a knowledge of the 
approximate numerical strength of the boers is a 
first essential in every endeavour to discover 
the lessons of the war if the boers 
num 87000 we have nothing to learn for at 
time have we had so many men in our 
BITING line with 2000 boors at 
KEG and about 10000 south of the orange 
riverassuming the cape times reliable 
there are 75000 divided between modder 
river and natal and as we have only OF 
000 or thereabouts with generals buller 
and METHUEN the numerical disparity thus 
shown is sufficient to explain our reverses 
on the other hand if there are ONLY 40000 
boers all told we are faced with a very 
different situation requiring a very 
different explanation for this reason may 
he of service if i discuss the question of the 
strength of the boer army in some detail

census returns 

the BOOK population according to 
our guide in estimating the numbers of 
the dutch in south africa is the fact that 
all persons of dutch extraction belong to 
the dutch reformed churches it is 
doubtful whether there are 100 dutchmen in the 
whole of south africa outside this religious 
classification and the census figures under 
the head of religion may therefore be taken 
with absolute confidence on april A 1891 
an elaborate and detailed census of the 
population of the capo colony was taken and 
when completed it was found that there 
were 114980 males and 113641 females 
who belonged to the dutch CHURCH total 
of 228027 persons it will not bo difficult 
therefore if we can find the approximate 
rate of natural increase in the dutch 
population to make a very close guess as 
the NUMBERS of the dutch population in 
the cape colony 
in the grange free state the last census 
was taken on march OF 1890 audit was 
found there were 68940 souls in the dutch 
church of a total population of 
whites 
in british BECHUANALAND the census taken 
in 1891 gave 5254 whites and in natal 
the enumeration of april 1891 gave a total 
of 44415 whites 

number op transvaal boers 

confirm each other broadly and make it 
certain that the boer population consisted 
of about 50000 persons in 1890 when the 
free state census was taken there was 
no dutch immigration to the transvaal till 
after 1890 and not much then thus we 
get the following figures as the dutch 
population of the republics and the cape 
colony in 

cape colony 1891 228627 
orange free state 1890 68940 
transvaal 1890 estimated 50000 
total 817567 

the voting lists 

perhaps before going further i may add 
here evidence which confirms these 
VAAL FIGURES in 1892 a hotly contested 
election for the position of president was 
fought out in the transvaal every vote 
and all males above sixteen are entitled to 
VOTES polled it was openly stated 
at the time in the transvaal that a 
considerable number of persons had voted more 
than ONCE LEONARDO statement 
house of commons committee 1896 the 
results were KRUGER 7854 JOUBERT 7009 
HOTZE OF total 14944 votes this 
number included all burghers english as well 
as dutch further according to a statement 
compiled by the registrar of deeds at 
TORIN the number of farms held by burghers 
in the transvaal in 1896 was 5575 

a very imperfect census was taken in 
the transvaal in 1890 and the total white 
population was returned at 119128 whites 
of whom 59334 were returned as born in 
the country while the total white 
population was given at 119128 the number of 
voters was catalogued at 12438 i do not 
think that implicit reliance can be placed 
upon these figures at all events AS regards 
the uitlander population for i can 
personally testify to the fact that the demands of 
the census-taker were treated generally as 
a joke AYDIN very many eases the 
schedules were never called for the figures must 
therefore bo supplemented from other 
sources 
oo march OF 1877 before the 
annexation sir t shepstono wrote to lord 
narvonthe white strength of the 
VAAL consists at the outside of 8000 men 
capable of bearing arms of these about 
1000 live in towns and villages and 350 
are the foreign and fluctuating population 
collected at the goldfields the remaining 
6650 are all farmers widely scattered in 
isolated homesteads over a surface equal to 
that of great britain and ireland put 
together 
a petition sent to england in 1878 
claimed by the boers to be signed by 
nearly the whole dutch manhood of the 
VAAL over twenty-one years of age 
contained 6591 names of an estimated total of 
800ushowing that the boers endorsed 
sbepstones estimate given above 
in 1881 the boer government had an 
estimate of the population compiled and 
the result as given in our BLUEBOOKS 
wasenglish 5030 dutch 38230 again 
in 1886 the dutch churches took a census 
from their books and the total was 45500 
souls 
now these transvaal estimates made at 
different times by different agencies nil 

the rate of increase 

now what is the rate of increase of the 
dutch population of south africa it is 
usual to assume that the dutch increase 
very rapidly but while this is true the 
rate of mortality amongst the children is 
considerable there is little difficulty 
however in ascertaining the rate of increase 
the number of persons classed as belonging 
to the dutch church in 1875 was 166148 
and taking the same area the cape colony 
extended its boundaries in the interval 
the number in 1891 was 211921 cape 
census p OF this gives us an increase 
of A per cent in OF years according to 
MULHALL the population of europe 
increased OF per cent in ten years BETWEEN 1887 
and 1891 and the natural increase 
excluding immigration of the white population 
of the l UNITED states fox the same period 
was OF per cent if therefore i place the 
natural increase of the dutch population of 
south africa at OF per cent for the nine 
years between 1890 and 1899or more than 
twice the european RATE am conceding as 
much as any critic can reasonably demand 
then repeating the table given above of 
the population of the two states most 
concerned the following results are obtained

TON in since OF at present 
274350

total 347567 69511 417078 
we see then that the total boer 
population of south africa excluding natal but 
including BECHUANALAND amounts to 420 
000 souls and it is only necessary to 
ascertain WHAT proportion of this population 
is capable of bearing arms to arrive at the 
military strength of the republics and of

cavalry at the cape 

the report that the war office HAS decided 
not to send a fourth cavalry brigade to the 
cape when coupled with the statement that 
WORD roberts considers the british cavalry too 
heavy for the work they are now called upon to 
lo makes it desirable to revert ONE more to the 
question of the employment of indian cavalry in 
south africa we are unable to believe that 
lord ROBERTS has declined the services of ad 
DICTIONAL cavalry because he holds that he is 
already sufficiently strong in the mounted arm 
the more reasonable inference is that as he 
REGARDS british cavalry AS unsuitable for the 
veldt he prefers to do without mounted 
reinforcements in pursuance of that view the opinion 
bus attributed to the at 
the cape has already FOUND expression in other 
authoritative quarters it was predicted weeks 
ago that regiments like the household cavalry 
the royals and scots greys would not be 
mobile enough for the rought irregular work 
alloted to cavalry in the present campaign 
so far as the cavalry are concerned the chief 
honours of the war have been carried off up 
to the present by the lightly-equipped horsemen 
of the colony who are mounted upon small 
horses further reinforcements of cavalry of 
the same light type would probably he of the 
utmost value at the present juncture we 
venture to surmise thatpolitical considerations 
APARITIF lord roberts had been offered a 
brigade of indian cavalry he would have 
ACCEPTED the offer with alacrity native lancers 
are ideal troops for the duties imposed upon 
cavalry in the present war they are dexterous 
in HANDLING their weapons unequalled at 
scouting inured to the trials of a hot climate and 
above all they are light cavalry in the best sense 
f the TERM the hesitation evinced by the 
authorities to utilise a splendid force of the type 
most needed in south africa is in keeping will 
the rest of the blunders which have marked the 
conduct OUTHE war the employment of INDIAN 
troops has been forbidden from motives 
admittedly excellent but the time has come when 
abstract principles should give way to 
considerations of expediency the cavalry STRENGTH of 
the army at the cape will not suffice until the 
end of the war lord roberts thinks british 
cavalry too heavy and declines to have any 
more and yet a large potential source of supply 
of trained men and horses is rejected in favour 
i a scratch force of yeomen whose pluck and 
enthusiasm will have to make up for their 
ignorance of scouting work and of the weapon 
which will form their chief arm before the siege 
of pretoria begins the war office will probably 
lie glad to avail itself of the services of indian 
cavalry mid it WOULD be more politic to admit 
THE principle while a margin of opinion remains 
already the government has had to throw to 
the winds one of the theories cherished when war 
was declared the idea then was to refuse the 
assistance of the colonists in south africa 
hie war should be fought said these amiable 
dreamers by british soldiers alone if we 
alow the colonists to take up arms against the 
boors the two races will never settle down 
peaceably when the strife is over let us there 
loro rely upon british troops so that no more 
SEAS of mutual hatred may be sown the 
people who will have to live together afterwards 
before the first shot was fired this attitude was 
PARTIALLY abandoned but even when sir REDVERS 
BITTER landed in natal he was still loth to utilise 
I NAIL JOY the very doctors and nurses 
who had been ejected from johannesburg found 
THEIR offers of help slighted all that is 

CHANTE gazette 

ged now in natal and at the cape the men 
who have been eagerly volunteering for service 
at the front find their assistance gladly accepted 
we hope and believe that before long there WIFI 
be a similar reversion to COMMONSENSE views 
regarding the employment of indian cavalry the 
opposition to native troops is said to emanate 
EMET bom the colonists themselves but we 
have been unable to find any traces of sent 
mental hostility to the indian soldiers of the 
queen either in south african newspapers or 
m TIME speeches of prominent colonial statesmen 
nor do we anticipate that any real objection 
he feared from the colonists they have seen 
their land invaded and homes violated and ARE 
not likely to hamper the success of BRITISH arms 
by clinging to an unworthy prejudice one of 
the other arguments urged against indian 
cavalry that the loss of british officers would be 
tun great that objection we venture to point 
out must apply to every war in which indian 
troops may engage if the military authorities 
do not care to use native regiments against the 
boers because they fear the british officers will 
be dangerously conspicuous it is not 
unreasonable to ask what the official view will be if we 
ever find ourselves at war with russia for 
years no notice has been taken of the urgent 
entreaties of competent advisers to increase the 
proportion of british officers attached to native 
regiments some day a terrible retribution may 
be exacted for this foolish parsimony which is 
steadily-weakening the value of our native ARMY 
as an effective fighting force but in the 
present mstnnee the argument does not hold good 
for there ARE plenty of men available to 
augment the normal strength of officers attached to 
ARTS 7lris8 
de other objections 
more fundamental in their character are ABLE 
I 
answered in the article by sir henry HAWORTH 
m the new number of the nineteenth centum 
finally it may be pointed out that opposition 
was originally anticipated not from the colonists 
or from the home government but from the 
GOVERNMENT of lidia it was thought possible 
that foi reasons which may well remain 
undiscussed the government of india would hav 
been reluctant to consent to pit native troops 
against the boers we believe we are correct in 
stating that the government of india does not 
TOOK unfavourably and never has looked 
unfavourably upon the proposal to send a force of 
native cavalry to south africa if that be the 
case we trust that the scruples of the home 
government or the war office or the colonist 
will soon be overcome a beginning might be 
made by despatching a single regiment it may 
be confidently anticipated that any one of the 
crack regiments of native cavalry would so far 
justify the honour thus conferred upon it that a 
whole brigade would soon be asked for

MMS jean wauchofe widow of the late 
general wauchope has sent the following letter 
to the press 
statements have I understand been made 
that the last letter which i received from my 
husband general wauchope contained criticism 
on lord METHUEN conduct and that my 
hand expressed a feeling that he was being sent 
to his death i wish to deny these STATEMENTS 
most emphatically there is not a shadow of 
truth in them my husband would never have 
criticised his chief even in private letters to his 
wife and nothing would have hurt him more 
than to feel that anyone else would do so my 
husband s inst mention to me of lord METHUEN was 
contained in a letter dated november 291899 
orange river and was as follow 

i expect METHUEN will halt on the modder 
for some days BEFORE pushing forward he has 
had a hard time of it and must he a real gallant 
soul to shove along as he does 

referring to the DOLENS reverse the 
correspondent of the daily chronicle SCYTHE attack to 
the onlooker was purely a frontal attack by three 
bodies of troops separated by no great distance 
the face of the enemy was attacked point blank 
by each brigadewhether on the nose right or 
left cheek seemed a detail there was no question 
of giving the boer a REGULAR round-arm swinging 
blow UNDERGONE of his ear the face and face only 
was the object of the military pugilist over all 
this however the bravery of the british soldier 
and colonial volunteer stands in supreme 
grandeur it mattered not to tommy and his 
leaderwhether the plan was good had or indifferent he 
fought on with that stolid indifference and 
bravery that is so characteristic of the 
british soldier alone his orders and the enemy 
were his only thoughts ho never winced or 
wavered for a second as the rain of hail beat 
into the ranks and reduced the number of his 
friends he marched on with a glaring eye on 
the spitting hills ahead and grasped his rifle a 
little tighter maybe as he hoped for revenge 
and victory we see a good deal of tommy 
ATKINS in the streetnot always the best side of 
HILAND we often think very lightly of him and 
his but i dont think that anybody could have 
seen him fighting on december OF on the banks 
of the tugela without having the very deepest 
respect for him
