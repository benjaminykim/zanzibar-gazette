In the Budget Committee of the Reich- 
stag Herr Dernburg replying to the criti- 
cisms on tire policy of reform in East Africa 
denied that the natives were lazy and 1111— 
teachable and said that a regulation for 
recruiting was imperative as the present- 
system often differed but little from the 
slave hunts of the Congo. 
• Air. Winston Ohnrclnli who \vas th.e guest 
of the British East African Association at 
dinner said that he hoped it would be pos- 
sible to make proposals to Parliament to 
extend the Uganda Railway to Lake Albert. 
In the House of Commons, Mr. Hardy 
(Liberal) put a motion regretting the failure 
of the reforms in Macedonia, urging the 
Government to press for the establishment 
of executive control by an authority respon- 
sible to the Powers. Sir Edward Grey 
stated that separate action on the part of 
Great Britain was out of the question for 
the reasons that it would be ineffective 
and would entail uncontrollable conse- 
quences: the maintenance of the concert 
was necessary to peace. 
Mr. Winston Churchill speaking at the 
Butish East African Association dinner 
stated that they were all agreed to try to 
make British East Africa a great success 
and wanted to know how to attract a white 
population there quickest. The Govern- 
ment wanted to encourage the bona fide 
settler and not the speculator. He affirmed 
that the day was coming when the Uganda 
Railway would pay a dividend on the whole 
capital expenditure and he believed that by 
Connecting the lakes effectively the radius 
ot die railway would be doubled. 
Cricket.—The Australians’ innings closed 
tor 422. England has scored 117 for the 
loss of six wickets. 

The Queen and Prince of the Netherlands 
while driving at the Hague collided with an 
electric tram. Three wheels of the car- 
nage were wrenched off and their High- 
nesses had a miraculous excape.

■pV^Vffiuth has introduced a licensing 
Bm which provided for a progressive system 
ot reduction of licenses generally throughout 
the country for the next fourteen years 
until a uniform ratio has been reached 
between the number of licenses and the 
population. It involves the extinction of 
over thirty thousand licenses with compen- 
sation varying according to time, fourteen 
years from now being the limit when the 
value of present licenses will cease alto- 
gether. The issue of new licenses will be 
made subject to local option.

the second killed three outriders, wounded

The British Embassy at Berlin has for- 
warded a report on cotton cultivation in the 
various German Colonies in 1906—7 It 
says of German East Africa:— “There is 
plenty of Crown land suitable for cotton 
grow ing, which is therefore carried ou not 
only m small allotments and by natives but 
also m European style. Artificial irrigation 
is urgently required, but the land is so cheap 
that expenses for heavy irrigation could well 
be borne The harvest of 1900 amounted 
inm , es o0° Pounds each: that of 
1JU7 °my commenced in September and 
cannot yet he estimated. The natives get 
from 30 to 80 pfennigs (3f-.5d.) per pound 
ot raw cotton.” 

i ®HV3Iia3Y’s Mear Book for East Africa, 
1903, is now published and should be wel- 
comed by everybody in this part of the world 
who wants facts at hand with regard to 
places, people and events of East° Africa 
generally. It is a complete calendar, direc- 
tory and gazetteer for British East Africa 
and Zanzibar; and contains much informa- 
tion about Uganda and German East Africa. 
The work has been arranged and compiled 
by Air. Yorub Ali Drurnkey late Private 
Secretary to H. IT. the Sultan of Zanzibar 
and reflects the greatest credit ou that 
gentleman for his painstaking industry. For 
the first time we have a compilation' of the 
kind worthy to be classed with the “Natal 
Directory” one of the best books of the 
kind we have seen. 
The table of contents shows the book 
made up of nine sections:— (1) The Calen- 
dar; (2) Historical; (3) Development, Fi- 
nances, Trade; (4) State, Parliamentary etc., 
Civil List; (5) Acts and Ordinances of the 
Year; (6) AliscellaneousInformation; (7) De-

Me AVisstok CmmcHiLL recently inter- 
viewed by the correspondent of the Vu- 
-miwiham Daily Post said,—“There were 
parts of the East Africa Protectorate, which, 
ir their beauty, in the coolness of the an, 
in the richness of the soil, in their verdure, 
in the abundance of running water and in 
their fertility absolutely surpassed any- 
thinc that he had seen tn North or South 
Africa or in India, and challenged compari- 
son with the fairest regions nr England, 
Prance or Italy.” It is just in the heart 
of this attractive country that the Zanzrbar 
Government has established its Best 
House" for the recuperation of the health 
• of its officials and available when not so 
used for others. 

The many friends of Admiral Sir Harry 
Rawson still left in Zanzibar will be pleased 
to hear that he has been asked to remain 
'mother year in his post as Governor ol 
New South AValcs. The Morning Post 
correspondent recently writing from Syd- 
ney says;—“In New South Wales we have 
never ‘had a Governor as popular as Sir 
Harry Eawson, whose departure when it 
does 'occur will mean the breaking of many 
ties of affection and admiration. 

Prom time to time from remote parts of 
the Islands the existence of extremely old 
people is reported. . 
There may be seen any day in Zanzibar 
coming to the Port Office a patriarch who 
claims to he 11(5 years old and there aie 
many things to bear out his statement. 
His name is Belail bin Suliman and he 
came to Zanzibar in 1832 that is 70 years 
hack, in the service of Said bin Sultan. He 
was then a gunner on board the Shahalam. 
Before being promoted to gunner he had 
been a quartermaster so was probably from 
35 to 40 years old as he must have been 
many yeare at sea to have risen to be gunner, 
a step above quartermaster. A few of the 
ships he served in are the Shahalam, Eedh- 
klam, Cerniil, Mantes, Salehi, Gazali, Ati- 
trehiiean, Artauds, Nasri and several others. 
He is still wonderfully “lively” for his age. 
His eyesight and hearing are perfectly good 
and lie seems in clear possession of all his 
senses. 
He was taken off his ship by Seyyicl Bar- 
ghush who told him he was too old to go to 
sea, and was put in charge of the Palacq 
Fla’c. Last .year a sad blow came; the 
Government pensioned him off with one 
year's pay. The hale old veteran still comes 
io thc Port Office daily to see if there is any 
work for him. He is able to mend flags

JOHN MUKPHY. 

Judgment. 

This is an appeal from the finding and 
sentence of Judge Bnszard who convicts 
one John Murphy on February 18 for cheat- 
ing under Section 420 and sentenced him 
to a month’s simple imprisonment ana n 
The facts are fully set out on the learned 
Magistrate’s judgment and it is not neces- 
sary to repeat them here. I have oorn.d- 
ered all the evidence very carefully! 
though the offence is one which from ms 
nature must be treated cautiously. I think 
there was sufficient evidence before the 
Magistrate to qualify him m convicting 
the appellant, I accordingly uphold the 
conviction. - , 
I also agree with the. sentence passed by 
Judge Busznrd. A month’s imprisonment 
andli fine is not, in my opinion at all a 
severe sentence for an offence ot this des- 
cription which resulted in the confidence 
being deprived of a diamond ring worth 
At the same time Mr. Beece has called 
attention to the dangerous state of ihe 
prisoner’s health who is obviously suffering 
from consumption. On bis arrest by fcc.o 
dram he was kept in Aden prison for some 
weeks pending his transfer to Zanzibar for 
trial and the prison medical authority; there 
has put on record the fact that the prisoner 
was in a bad state of health and recom- 
mended an early change of air. ^ 
Under these circumstances I hesitate oO 
send him to confinement in a tropical prison 
where his heal th may break down altogether 
and where he, of necessity, cannot receive 
the same attention as he would in EngLnd 
where there is a Resident Medical Officer 
and nurses. 
AAfliilst therefore in confirming thn 
sentence passed upon him I have decided - Y 
view of the fact that it is absolutely necessare 
for the present state of his health that hr 
should not be confined in Zanzibar to ore.e 
that his term of imprisonment date from 
the time when he was arrested in Aden 
i. e. from December 24, provided his friends 
send him away from Zanzibar at once. 
As more than one month has elapsed 
from that date the prisoner will ho released 
on payment of the fine of BsMOO and a 
guarantee that he will immediately leave 
this country.
