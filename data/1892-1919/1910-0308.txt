Mr. G. N. Barnes, the Chairman of the Labour 
Party, speaking at Grimsby stated that if they 
were convinced that the Government could carry 
both the Budget and the Anti Veto Bill, they 
were not concerned with the order of procedure, 
and they would do their utmost to keep the 
Government in office.

Mr. Asquith moved to appropriate the time of 
the House until the 24th March of the purpose of 
passing urgent supplies, then, after the Easter 
recess, introduce Resolutions in both Houses ex- 
cluding the House of Lords from dealing with 
Finance and ensuring the predominance of the 
House of Commons against the Lords Veto within 
a single Parliament, a Bill carrying out these 
resolutions will be introduced later. 
London, 1st March, 6-45 a. m. 

Mr. Asquith’s motion was adopted without a 
division. The exclusion of the R,eform of the 
House of Lords from the Government’s proposals, 
and the concentrations on the Veto, has relieved 
the tension in the Liberal Camp. The Radicals 
are jublilant. and the Nationalists also appear to 
be satisfied with the Governments assurances that 
they will not continue in office unless they are 
able to ensure their proposals becoming Law.

During the Debate on Somaliland Affairs, Mr. 
Winston Churchill assured the House that the 
forces at Sir Wm. Manning’s disposal were ade- 
quate for any movement he might he compelled 
to make. The situation arising from a mistaken 
policy of extending our responsibility to the in- 
terior, was most unsatisfactory. He deprecated 
spending money on a Railway, while there were 
other Railways on the East Coast which were so 
much better worth building; if the money which 
had been squandered in Somaliland had been 
spent on Uganda and East Africa the latter’s out- 
put of Ores, Rubber and Cotton, would have been 
greatly increased.

Naval Ports at night, this is to give Notice that 
on approaching the shores of Great Britain, or 
ally port of the British Empire, if search lights 
are observed to be in constant operation, the 
Naval Ports should be approached with great 
caution, as it it may be apprehended that obstruct- 
ions may exist outside, or that the entrances may 
be altogether closed. 

. (2) If an entrance to a port is closed, three red 
vertical lights by night, or three red balls by day, 
will be exhibited in some conspicuous position, in 
or near to its approach, and as far as possible 
notice of this fact will be given by look-out vessels 
in the offing. 

In this case vessels must either proceed to the 
position marked “Examination Anchorage” on 
the Admiralty charts and anchor there, or keep 
the sea. 

(3) At all the ports or localities at home or 
abroad referred to at the end of this Notice, search 
lights are occasionally exhibited for exercise, and 
this may make navigation difficult when approach- 
ing them. 

Instructions have been given to avoid directing 
moveable lights towards vessels under way, but 
mariners are.,warned that great caution is neces- 
sary when search lights are being exercised.

conferred by the section relates only to entries for 
the purpose of carrying out searches. The word 
“warehouses” would seem to indicate that such 
was the intention of the legislature; and further, 
to construe the section otherwise would be to 
read it'as inconsistent with. a. number of other 
legislative enactments, - . y A J . 

Such enactments are jl) Article 53 of the Order 
in Council 1906 and Article H of the Order in 
Council 1897 which apply the Code of'Criminal- 
Procedure to all persons subject to the jurisdic- 
tion of the Britisn Court; (2) Section 10 of the 
Police Decree (No. 2 of 1908) whereby the detective 
(inter alias) is invested with all. the. powers of a 
Member of the Police Force (See King s Regula- 
tion No. 2 of the 1908): (3>Section .54 (1) and Sec- 
tions 47 and 48 of-the Criminal Procedure Code 
by which any police offic r is timpqwerd without 
warrant to arrest any person .who has been con: 
cerned (as the said Swedan. had) in acognizabje 
offence, and if necessary to demand free ingress 
into any-room or break down any outer or inner 
door to effect the-arrest: and (4) Sections of the 
Zanzibar Courts Decree (Ko. 8 of 1908) which 
applies the Criminal Code to all persons subject 
to the jurisdiction, of.Zanzibar Court and there- 
fore to the Zanzibar Police. 

I think the true' explanation is that the legisla- 
ture in<ended the fourth section of the Decree 
No. 7 of 1908 to apply, only ta.'searches .and to no 
cases other than searches. And even with regard 
to such searches,- this right is now conferred on 
the Police by section 8 of the Decree No. 8 of 
1908, ... 

I-am for these reasons of bpinioh that the 
Magistrate was misled in. bis.reading of Sec: 4 of 
the Jurisdiction of the British Court Decree, and 
that Wilson had no right, to .'refuse entrance to 
the Detective .. .. 

Another point was mentioned in the applica- 
tion, but Mr. Mead states that he did not ask for 
any variation of the Magistrate’s order, because the 
real object of the application for revision Was 
not so much to obtain an enhancement of the 
sentence as to ilicit a declaration that the 
Police have in cognizable cases a right to arrest 
without warrant persons \yhq ar,e subject to the 
British Court. I therefore do not Vary the Ma- 
gistrate's order. . :,.n. ..... 

I ought perhaps to add that it is quite clear in 
my opinion that the Criminal Procedure Code 
(except in so far as-it ias been varied by any 
decree subsequent to No. 8 of 1908) applies in 
toto to the PolieejForee, and that Sec : 8 of that 
Decree must be taken to have repealed Sec: 4 of 
No. 7 of 1908 and Section 2 of the King’s Regula- 
tions No. 2 of 1908 which refused to' extend the 
powers of the Police under Sections 7 and 24 of 
No. 8. of 19U8-to persons.who were subject to the 
British Court.. 

The result of the application therefore, is that I 
vary the Magistrate’s tindiug ip.regard to the 
powers of arrest vested in the Police in regard to 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of this Court, 
but under; circumstances of this case do not vary 
the order.

This is an application under Se.c: f of thp' Magis-

the revision of a sentence passed upon an Ameri- 
can subject named Wilson, whereby he was bound 
over by the Magistrate to keep the peace/ 

The facts are as'.follows:—A detective 'went 
recently to arrest one Swedan, a, servant of Wil- 
son’s, who was .'suspected <A having committed a 
cognizable. offence. Swedan had taken refuge in 
Wilson’s house, and Wilson refused I. > give him 
up. The Magistrate upon the authority of Sec: -1 
of the Jurisdiction of the British Court Decree 
(No. 7 of 1908) held that the detective had no 
right, to enter Wilson’s house for the purpose of 
arresting Swedan. The Section is as follow:— 

“ The houses, warehouses and other premises of 
“persons subject.to the British Court shall not 
“be entered. or searched by the Officers of our 
“ Government, without the consent of the. dccu- 
“ pier, except under a warrant issued, by the

med Premji deceased, who died in Zanzibar upon 
the 14th day of October 1907. The will deals 
only with self-acquired property. 

The clauses in the will are as follows: 

' “3rd. In Malindi Bazar, I have three shops, 
“one is now occupied by -Khatao Mulani,. another 
“shop by Manji Deraj, and the third one by 
“Bhaloo Yalli Govani. These three shops I make 
“Wakf in the name of two persons on these 
“conditions that they are not to be sold or mort 
“gaged arid cafinot be attached for any debts. J 
“make them Wakf only for the household expen- 
ses of -these'two persons. 

“It details :— 
“(a) One shop in which now Bhaloo Valli 
“Govani is livirig, I make Wakf for the household 
“expenses of my Suria by. name Shukuru. She 
“is to enjoy the rent, but she cannot sellor mort- 
“gage it, arid it she owes anything the Creditors 
“cannot attach the rent; . only she is to utilise 
“the rent of the house for her householdexpenses. 
‘‘After her death, this house is to be my son’s by 
“name Mahomed Premji born of the womt> of 
“Shukuru, him I give it on the condition that he 
“cannot sell or mortgage it and for any of his 
“debt the rent crinnot be attached 1 only make in 
“it Wakf for his expenses. A 
, A‘(b) Two (other) shops in which Khatao 
“Mulani is living and Manji Deraj is/hving, I 
“make Wakf in favour of my son Mahomed 
“Premji on condition, that he cannot sell 01 
“mortgage them, nor can their rent be attached 
“by his creditors. Whatever rent of these houses 
“may accrue my two executors should keep the 
“same credited with them , and they should not 
“aive it to my son Mahomed Premu. And my 
“son Mahomed should live along with his mother 
“Shukuru and his mother should defray all his 
“expenses, if he lives with her, it is good, and in 
“case he does not behave well, (with her) then 
“my executors are to pay him only Rs. •> a 
“month, and not a pesa more; but ^ ke behaves 
“well and trades and my executors think that he 
“is behaving well, then they can give him foi 
“purposes of trade from Rs. oOO to Rs. 1°00. Jtt 
“uot they are only to give him Rs. 5 a month. 
“On these conditions I make Wakf these two 
“shops in favour of my son; Mahomed Rreinji. 

“5th. My house in which I now live and which 
“has two doors one on West and the other on the 
“East, I make this Wakf in favour of my grand- 
“daughter Sikinabai on terms thaU she cannot 
“sell or mortgage it, nor; can its rent be attached 
"by her creditors, she is to use the rent for her 
“household expenses only- and on her death it 
“should go to her son Abdulhusein Ahmahomed 
“on the same terms that he can no - sell or mort- 
cr?' 
gage it nor can its rent be attacked f
“ditors. Ou these conditions I make Wakf m 
“favour of . my grand-daughter Sikinabai. But 
“so long as my Suria Shukuru is living there she 
“should pay as rent Rs. 200 a year and these Rs. 
“200 my .executors should keep credited in the 
“name of ‘Sikinabai jind give at time of Abdul- 
“husein’s marriage.” 

Three issues have been settled. The first is. 
“Bv what law is the will to be constru-d . . 
After some argument it was agreed upon the 
authority of Raschid r. Sherbanoo (29 B. 85) that 
the will of a Koja Mahomedan is governed, for- 
th e purposes of succession and inheritance, by 
Hindu Law. It was further agreed that the 
Hindu Wills Act of 1870 governs the will, and 
that according to the provisions of Section - of 
that Act the will must be construed in accordance 
wjtb the Sections of the Succession Act therein 

mentioned and by whatever other principles of 
the Hindu. Law of wills may be applicable to the 
ease. That disposes of the first issue. 

The second issue is: What interest (if any) do 
Mahomed Premji and Shukuru take under clause 
8 of the will? 

It is common ground that the single rule of 
construction in a Hindu, as in an English will is 
the meaning of the testator so far as it can bo 
ascertained from the document as a whole (Mayne, 
Hindu Law, 6th Edition, p. 557). Now in clause 
3 the testator purports to make wakj certain im- 
moveable property for the benefit of two persons 
Sfcukuru and Mahomed Premji. As the testator 
has used a Mahomedan word it would seem (and 
it was so agreed at-the bar) that the Mahomedan 
Law of Wakf applies as far as possible. This 
conclusion is supported by the remarks of Lord 
Justice Turner upon the construction of Hindu 
wills. He says, “Primarily the words of the will 
“are. to be considered. They convey the expres- 
“siori of the testator’s wishes; but the meaning 
“to-be attached to them may be affected by sur- 
“rounding circumstances, and where this is the 
‘case those circumstances no doubt must be re- 
garded. Amongst the circumstances thus 10 be 
‘.‘regarded is the law of the country under which 
‘‘the will is made and its dispositions are to be 
‘•‘carried out. If that law has attached to parti- 
“cular words, a particular meaning, or to a parti- 
cular disposition, a particular effect, it must be 
.“assumed that the testator, in the dispositions 
“which he has made had regard to that meaning 
“or to that effect, unless the language of the will 
"or the surrounding circumstances displace that 
“assumption.” (Soorjeemony Dasi v. DinaBandhu 
Mullick 6 Moo. I. A. 526, at 550; see Mahomed 
ShumsoolHooda v. Shewukram, alias Roy Doorga 
Pershad, 14 B. L. R. 226, 22 AV. R. 409; L. R. 2, 
I. A. 7; Narayani Dasi v. Administrator General 
of Bengal, I. L. R. 21 C, 683; Srinivasa « Danda- 
yudapani I. L. R. 12, M. 411 at 420; Arumugam 
Mudali v. Ammi Ammal, 1 M. H, C. R. 400) Ac- 
cordingly, in applying the rules of construction 
for ascertaining the intention of the testator, re- 
.gard must always be had (a) to the ‘‘habits of 
“thought and modes of expression prevalent 
“amongst those to whose language they are 
“applied” (Rai BishenChand v. Asmaida Koer, I. 
L. R. 6 A. 560; L. R. 11 I. A. 164; see Srinivasa 
v. Dandayudapani, supra); (6) to the usages of the 
class or family to which the testator belonged 
(Barlow v. Orde, 5 B. L. R. 1; 13 W. R. P. C. 41; 
13 Moo. I. A. 277); and (c) to the ordinary notions 
and wishes of Hindus with respect to the devolu- 
tion of their property (Mahomed Shumsool Hooda 
u. Shewukram, supra; Bhobatarini Debya v. Peary 
Lall Sanyal, I. L. R. 24 C., 646, at 651; Narayani 
Dasi v. Administrator General of Bengal, supra, 
at 692). 

Now the testator in this case was a Khoja 
Mahomedan who lived practically all his life as a 
Mahomedan in a Mahomedan country. In using 
the word ‘wakf’ he must have had in view the 
general meaning Of the word as used in Zanzibar. 
There is no such word as “wakf” in the Hindu 
Law and I think the testator would be surprised 
to know that his will is in fact being construed by 
Hindu Law. 

A Wakf is properly defined in the Mahomedan 
Law as a dedication in perpetuity of some specific 
property for a pious purpose. There is in this 
gift no provision for pious purposes and the gift 
is therefore bad as a Wakf (Nizamuddin Gulam v 
Abdul Gafur 13 B. 264) Mr. Framji now contends 
inasmuch as the wakf fails the whole gift is

C'The gift over of the same property is m general

an estate of inheritance will pass the entire estate

whole estate ot the grantor: I theretoro hold .that 
Mahomed Premji is entitled subject to the h e 
interstof Bhukuru to an absolute e0ta e pi th 
property. The restraints upon alienation and 
attachment are void, as also is the limitation ot 
the gift for household expenses. . 

I now come to clause (b) whereby certain pro- 
perty is given in wakf to Mahomed Premji. * s 
there is no charitable gift over, the devise is bac 
as a waki and 1 think, for the reasons that I have 
stated, that the gift must be construed as being 
made in general terms. It is the.relore sd far an 
absolute devisi to Mahomed Premji. But an- 
nexed to the devise is a string ol conditions. Ihe 
tirst is that the trustees shall take, the rents and 
profits for accumulation and payment to him ac- 
cording to his behaviour, I have, not without 
doubt, come to the conclusion that this condition 
is bad. The estate is not devised upon trust with 
a discretion vested in the trustees as was the case 
in the similar actions of Bekhar Akra v De Lruz 
19 B. 2il affirmed Ibid p. 770. (Sec the judg- 
ment of Gandy J. at pp. 226-7 and Vollubdas 
Damodar o. Thuker Ghordandass 14 B. b60). 
The gift is direct to.Mahomed Premji, and there 
is no gift over as there, was in Anandrao Yinayak 
v. a. G. of Bombay (20 B- 450).. The incidents 
annexed to the estate, therefore, appear to me to 
be repugnant-to the estate that the testator has

A^hrrS A.°452^' There A transferred to B his

oTb’s enjoyment of the estate conveyed was bad 
2 bein" igainst public policy and in violation, of 
Hnn'i Ih and 11 ol the I ransfer of Property 
Act If therefore I am right in holding Bhat 
Mahomed'Premji gets an absolute estate in this 
property, it must, 1 think, follow that-the cona- 
tions I have referred to are bad, and ! so hold 

The remaining condition namely -that Maho- 
med Preiuji should live with his mother is,-in my 
opinion, good. There is, it is . true, no definite; 
period of residence specified in the will, and 
cases wiicre residence in a particular house is ic- 
quired it has been held that exclusive residence is 
not supposed to be intended: the occasional use of 
the house and keeping an cstahlishmen m it with 
the intention of again using it as a r^> le“ce’,g„a 
sufficient compliance with the condition. ( ‘ 
nenda Tagore « Janendra Tajore 22 W. B. d77. 
Bhobatarini r Peary Lai 24 C. 640) This provision, 
however, is not quite upon the sameMogi g. 
What is required here is personal leblde^ ’ 
namely that Mahomed Proinji should reside with 
his mother. In these circumstances it has bee 
hold that 'an occasional residence;is not sufccien 
(Bhobatarini v Peary Lai 24 C. 646 at p. b5b In 
such cases it is a question ol fact, I think,, what 
constitutes sufficient residence. '/ . . 

Tor these reasons I hold that in regard to clause 
(b) Mahomed Premji takes an absolute estate m 
the property therein mentioned, subject only to 
the condition that ho lives with bhukuru, his 

1UItcome now to the third issue in the case. That 
issue is : “What, interest, (if any) Bakmabai 
take under the fifth clause of the will- i* By that 
clause certain property is made wakf to bikmabai 
for her household expenses, without words of limi- 
tation but with provision against ahehation ana 
attachment for debt. Upon her death the pro- 
perty is' to'go to Abdulhusein Alimahoined again 
without words of limitation but with sninlai 
restrictions upon alienation and stttachmeht. I rom 
the authorities 1 have quoted it is clear that ^ 
Sikinabai - is entitled to. a- life interest;;m the 
property in question arid that Abdulliusein A - 
mahomed is after her deatli entitled to the estate 
absolutely.' The restrictions concerning aliena- 
tion, attachment, and enjoyment limited . 
household expenses are all bad, witMregard 
both the life interest and the remainder over. 
No question arises in connexion with the ot e 
condition in the clause namely that' Snukur

should live in the house and pay rent at Bs. 200 
per annum. I am informed that Shukuru has 
vacated the premises and that all parties have 
agreed that no question is raised in this action 
with regard to that provision. 

A further complication is raised by the fourth 

issue which is as follows:— 

By whom is the mortgage debt existing upon 
the (self-acquired) properties mentioned in clauses 
3 and 5 of the will payable ? With regard to this 
point it is clear that the legacies are all specific. 
Mr. Suali has contended that the gift of a life 
interest being partial gift of a specific whole may 
be demonstrative, but I know of no authority for 
the contention. A lease of land has been named 
by the legislature as specific (Succession Sec. Act 
129, illustration (d).) A rent charge out of a term 
has been held specific (Long r. Short, P. Williams 
402) and a residuary devise of real estateis specific 
(Lancefield v. Iggulden L. R. 10 Ch. 136) see 
further William on Exors 9th edition pp. 1031-21 
hold that the legacies are all specific. It follows, 
therefore, by sec. 154 of the Succession Act. 
(Corresponding to Locke King’s Act in England) 
that the encumbrance is payable out of the 
devised estates and not out of the general assets 
of the testator. 

The costs of all parties will be paid out of the 

testator’s estate.
