mr sf van OSS contributes two articles on 
this subject one to the wnefcfla century and 
tho other to the investors review his paper 
which is entitled the gold mining madness 
in the city has the first place in the 
TEETH century but although he thinks it is 
madness he admits that there is method in 
it mr van OSS puts into a brief compass 
the salient facts which will enable the 
general public to understand the cause for the 
recent extraordinary boom in the rand in 
the transvaal there are fifty miles of gold 
reef of extraordinary richness 
dr SCHMEISSER and mr hamilton smith 
concur in estimating the value of tire gold in 
the district down to a depth of about 1200 
feet at somewhere between 300000000 
and 350000000 
besides this enormous mass of gold which 
is regarded as almost within sight there may 
be thousands of miles more which have not 
yet been prospected enough however is 
in sight to have called into existence an 
extraordinary industry the traveller when 
approaching to the gold mining region is 
astonished at the developments of the gold 
mining works 
the works which now directly employ 
50000 native miners and 8000 europeans 
crush with their 2700 stamps enough rook to 
produce over 200000 ounces of gold a mouth 
and the output of ore is so regular and 
reliable that there is literally no possibility of 
disappointment 
the regularity of the gold deposit in the 
rand district differentiates it from all other 
gold-mining localities 
a ton of ore yields on the average A IS 
D in gold to extract which costs only 
110s D hence over ONC-third of the 
gold produced is profit 

the improved methods of extracting the 
have made many of the mines profitable 
which could not otherwise have been 
WORKED 
in tile early days no more than ou per 
cent of the gold in the ore could be extracted 
at present with the aid of cyanide of 
potassium between OF and OF percent is gained 
and the proportion can before long he 
increased by another OF per cent coupled 
with the effects of railway construction this 
improvement HAS had remarkable results 
in the early days of the industry it did not 
pav to work ore with less than four ounces 
GOLD to the ton now five PENNYWEIGHTS 
suffice in ninny cases 
these are the facts which UNDERLINE the 
enormous boom which has taken place in 
all south african shares mr van OSA 
describing the wild gamble which has gone 
on in mining shares says 
within little more than half a year a 
condition of timid enterprise has gradually 
degenerated into a craze for reckless 
speculation a huge advance in values has taken 
place the aggregate quotation of 
rand shares alone has risen from 30000000 
last autumn to some 150000000 now a 
whole mushroom press has sprung up in 
the city largely called forth by the fosters 
ing sun of company advertising on an 
unstinted scale perhaps 25000 a week 
is now spent on bringing new mining 
ventures to the notice of the public the stock 
exchange is so active that after hours 
huge concourses of people have often 
obstructed traffic in throgmorton street to 
an extent which necessitated police 
intervention the three fortnightly settlement 
days had to be augmented by one because 
it was impossible to crowd all the work 
within the customary time many firms of 
stockbrokers have been forced to double their 
staff and to keep their offices open night 
and day at times 

while admitting that there is good 
justification for investment in the well known 
but pitifully managed mines he warns the 
investor that even if three million ounces 
are produced next year the total profit would 
not pay more than OF per cent on the 
present quoted value of the shares in the 
market for some time past all the interests 
have been combined to force up the prices 
but sooner or later it will come to be the 
interest of some of the speculators to play 
lor a fall thou he fears the market will 
break his final warning is as follows 
these south african shares are largely 
ARTIFICIAL though no doubt some shares are 
quoted at prices which represent their actual 
and intrinsic worth the rise has gone so 
dangerously far now that even the augmented 
output of next year must fail to offer an 
adequate interest upon the capital invested 
further i wish to emphasise the fact that 
the danger of collapse is especially great in 
this market where strained conditions 
prevail mid where control rules irresponsible 
inscrutable and all powerful predictions 
are dangerous and gloomy forecasts 
unpleasant to make but unless this mad 
boom is checked if it is still possible to 
check it there will come a day of denouement 
which must load to a collapse so huge that 
the entire business world will feel the shock

dr JAMESON 

position 

the english press still teems with articles 
and correspondence on ur JAMESON action 
and consequent position some are of 
interest from the authority of the writer some 
from the actual knowledge of circumstances 
affecting the recent surprise movement we 
take os a specimen of the former class the 
following letter to the times dealing with 
the question of raiding and the legal guilt 
thereof 

what is a raid 

SILIN tie times of jan WITH on page 
OF is a letter from sir herbert stephen on 
the case of dr jameson WHICH is worthy of 
all the respect due to his name and authority 
of course i do not for a moment mean to 
question the legal arguments contained in 
that letter but it seems to me as one who has 
a sincere respect for dr jameson that 
the state of facts about to be judicially 
investigated are not fully set forth in the 
second paragraph of sir herbert STEPHENS 
letter 

it seems to me from the correspondence 
and information which we have all read 
lately in the newspapers that the following 
facts have escaped sir herbert STEPHENS 
consideration 

I dr jameson was the administrator of 
the nearest territory under the rule of the 
chartered company which was on the frontier 
of the transvaal 

A he commanded the nearest police force 

to that state 

A this police force mainly recruited from 
sir charles warrens BECHUANALAND police 
force is always mounted and armed 

A sir herbert stephen says that if 
jameson was committing no crime when he 
raided the transvaal to this expression 
OF venture to ask whether raid is a legal 
i expression a raid or foray is a hostile 
i expedition without declaration of war for 
the purpose of plunder i do not think that 
i dr JAMESON name can he associated with 
such a charge 

A the circumstances of dr JAMESON 
march with his mounted police towards 
johannesburg were that mr esselen 
the homo secretary of the boer 
i ment had appointed a trained british police 
i officer to SUPERINTEND the johannesburg police 
force that ft mr ESSELEN colleagues had 
discharged this officer because he was not a 
boer e that mr esselen had in 
CONSEQUENCE office and that d the 
POLICE had become disorganised 

it was in consequence of this that dr 
jameson answered the appeal of his 
countrymen in johannesburg to come and afford 
them the protection of the nearest police 
whilst so employed he was tired upon by 
armed boers in overwhelming numbers and 
surrendered 
A sir herbert stephen also i have no 
doubt by a slip of the pen speaks of dr 
JAMESON objective as pretoria the 
objective was johannesburg 
i hope sir you may think it right to 
publish this criticism on sir herbert 

PENS letter that these additional facts 
maybe weighed by the public 

i am sir your obedient servant 

john c dalkymiie hay bt admiral 

108 st Georges-square sw 
the other letter is addressed to the same 
paper and gives many interesting facts about 
the boers and their own continued history of 
raiding 

the boer raids 

SIR correspondent states in your 
columns that the boers own and occupy 
some eleven-twelfths of the TRANSVAAL 
this is an entire mistake i should be 
surprised to find that they own more than half 
that country the acquisition of farms in 
the transvaal by outsiders is no new thing 
thirty years ago there was hardly a natal 
or cape colony merchant who had not his 
safes stuffed with title-deeds to them 
were a drug in the market and i have seen 
the papers of a 6000 acre farm given for a 
bottle of gin i have known outsiders who 
possessed over a hundred 6000 acre farms 
at that time and all the FARSEEING ones 
held on to them in 1806 i was for months 
riding about the purchasing 
ersrights these rights which entitled 
the holder to the freehold to a 6000 acre 
farm were granted to any one who resided 
for six months in the republic the 
colonial merchants used to engage loafers to go 
up and squat on some eligible farm and 
when they had done their six months on 
one removed to another and so on for 
years obtaining a right for EACH 
sixmonths residence eventually the boer 
government found that it had issued more 
rights than it had land to satisfy them and 
commissions were sent out to decide on the 
claims of rival holders of rights several 
of which were sometimes issued in respect 
of the same area at the end of 1866 i 
travelled for two months with one who 
under the presidency of the same piet 
ert who is now known as the general 
was to adjudicate on the rights issued for 
the districts of leydenberg and 
kerstroom JOUBERT method of award was 
to decide in favour of holders who were his 
friends and acquaintances i say this 
advisedly for i know as a positive fact that the 
earliest-dated papers were over and over 
again rejected my experience on this 
commission and in many other dealings with 
them led me ever afterwards to decline 
taking the word of any transvaal boer though 
ho swore it on a thousand bibles i should 
say that OF years ago quite a fourth of the 
transvaal was held by outsiders and few 
parted with their holdings the recent 
purchases are still larger 
it is very amusing to one who is not 
onlyintimately- acquainted with tho boers 
themselves but with their history as well to hear 
the virtuous indignation which they and 
their friends have poured out on poor 
son and his raiders av sir if there 
was ever a race of raiders upon this globe 
it is THE transvaal boers their whole 
existence has been one long succession of raids 
upon their neighbours black and white I 
doubt if a year ever passed since in 1836 
first entered the country in which they 
had not a raid on hand putting aside their 

numerous raids on the MATABELES the zulus 
THE bakwains the BAMANGWATO the 
longs the griquos the BASUTOS the BASED 
the SHANGAAN the SWAZIS the knohnoses 
and many other coloured races how often 
have they not raided english communities 
and english possessions in 1842 raided 
DURBAN which had been held by the 
lish for OF years and besieged the place for 
OF days with 600 men in 1848 
attacked the english community at bloemfontein 
in 1852 they attacked and destroyed 
stones station at SYPHILIS in later years 
they seized upon what was really english 
territory in ZULULAND in the early eighties 
they raided stellaland and goshenland and 
had to be turned out sir charles warren 
and in 1890 they attempted to raid 
ERLAND and were prevented the tact 
patience and bravery of this same maligned 
jameson who without spilling a drop of 
blood averted a terrible war how different 
the way they met his raid ASHY sir 
the pot is white when you come to compare 
it with the kettle jameson argued the boers 
out of english territory the boers maximed 
jameson out of theirs 
of course precipitancy is to be deprecated 
but the reign of the boer must come to an 
end he is ignorant stupid and obstinate 
and totally unfitted to exercise government 
functions he is crafty and deceitful and 
incapable of a straightforward action and 
a menace to the peace of the world he is 
as great an anachronism in africa as tho 
turk is in europe

george lacy 

in praise of smoke 

for DISPELLING malaria 

not of smoking but of good LIONET smoke-filled 
rooms eased down a bit short of choking 
smelling of the fire and the woodland cottage this 
most simple yet it is said effective preventive against 
malaria has not been given the trial it seems to 
deserve from the enunciations of certain authorities 
whose statements deserve mention here in the 
columns of a paper circulated mainly in malarious 
districts 
dr j murray the author of that very useful 
work entitled OTR to live in tropical africa says 
concerning the use of fire 
fires judiciously and persistently used both 
within and without dwellings in africa are of 
highest sanitary value for internal use the 
ordinary brazier which resembles the lower section 
of an iron pot with ventilating holes at the bottom 
answers excellently well as i have proved by long 
personal experience of course other stoves may 
be used with equal or greater advantage 
a fire of this kind should be kept smouldering 
all night during damp cold weather to maintain an 
equable temperature in chamber keep things dry 
expel mosquitoes and destroy the germs of malaria 
whenever hr temperature falls sufficiently 
to make AFIRE tolerable it should he used by day 
and night as a protection against ever present 
malaria 
fire of course consumes all germs that are 
wafted through it and in addition its pyroligneous and 
carbonic acids other products of combustion hurt 
or kill the germs by disturbing the equilibrium 
of their molecular structure and chemical medium 

the gazette 

TYNDALL found that air passed over a spirit lamp 
was immediately freed from germs and other 
floating matter and professor schenk has shown that 
MICROORGANISMS in the air of a room move towards 
the warmed bodies by a vital process initiated by 
the stimulus of heat fire can thus attract and 
destroy floating microbes 
the natives of africa burn small fires in their 
huts day and night during the rains 
burning large bonfires all night before houses 
during the rainy season and foggy weather is also 
most useful as i have proved by personal 
experience 
in shortfire is the one perfect disinfectant in 
the tropics being cheaper safer more effective 
and handier than any chemical agent whether 
powder fluid or vapour neither MALARIA mould 
fog damp or mosquitoes can permanently abide in 
a chamber where it is judiciously and PERSEVERINGLY 
burned 
i owe six months immunity in a sickly camp 
to fire 
INNESS and absence of mould upon boots walls 
furniture and books roughly indicate that the house 
or chamber is in good sanitary conditions in the 
tropics 
fires by night also protect the body against 
chills a man turns into his tent or hut says 
mr waller thoroughly tired by the heat he finds 
it impossible to bear the blanket over him he falls 
asleep and the cooler the night becomes the more 
soundly be slumbers before A a m the 
thermometer falls rapidly he awakes with a chilly feeling 
he pulls his blanket over him but the mischief is 
done in OF hours he is likely to be prostrated with 
fever to obviate this it is wise to have a few logs 
smouldering in the huts 
we expect the ladies would have something to 
say about dr murrays recommendations as to the 
state of a house inside with regard to its salubrity 
after commending the floors of the huts in which 
the whole area is generally covered with a thick 
layer of ANTHILL clay or stiff yellow clay which is 
thoroughly tempered and trodden in firmly and 
smoothly by the natives feet in time becoming 
saturated with grease and oil forming a perfect 
cement he addsfires are kept constantly 
burning by night and sometimes by day on the 
floors OUTHE huts during THECOID and raining months 
besides which there are numerous fires lighted 
under cooking-sheds so that the ATMOSPHERE in and 
out of doors is at times as reeky and healthy as 
that of an irish cabin the greasy warm smoky 
air of such villages is very antiseptic and it 
appears to afford protection from malaria and the 
same thing has been noticed in home and other 
towns with a malarial history 
the views expressed above have recently received 
confirmation from an italian scientist 
m PAOLOZZI asserts that he has discovered by 
repented experiments that the smoke produced by 
burning wood is a very efficacious disinfectant 
capable of destroying the germs of disease that are 
suspended in the atmosphere or that have settled 
on the walls and furniture as well as those to be 
found in the substance of the tissues of which our 
clothing is composed on this account the 
abovementioned italian physician believes that wood 
smoke is a very practical and economical means 
whereby to disinfect the rooms of sick persons or 
other contaminated spaces 
of disinfection should be as complete as possible 
it it necessary to use wood that is relatively green 
so as obtain the largest possible amount of smoke 
during its combustion care should be taken to keep 
hermetically closed the windows and doors of the 
room finally this fumigation should be renewed 
several times in succession at intervals of twelve 
hours it is hardly necessary to say that the room 
should be abandoned during the course of 
treatment 

in order that this process 

march A 1896

there is nothing surprising 

as regards the special element 

in the fact that wood smoke has an antiseptic value 
IU view of the use that has been made of it from 
time immemorial in preserving meat the only point 
in the question was to think of using this quality 
for the disinfection of rooms 
of smoke to which it owes its antiseptic properties 
mm SCRAPING and GARO who have studied the 
effect of wood smoke on the vitality of different 
microbes have ascertained that the products of the 
distillation of tar the soluble hydrocarbon appear 
to be the only really active elements of smoke the 
rest of it being merely accessory the proof of 
this fact is that when the EMPYREUMATIC products 
are stopped on their way by making the smoke pass 
through a long tube filled with cotton the gas that 
comes out of the other end hinders the 
development of microbes but does not destroy them 
power of wood smoke appears to be beyond 
question and the method of disinfecting dwellings by 
this very simple means will be certain to be of 
great use

EXPLAIN 

ENDED social democrat converts his too 
ardent follower by first admitting that if the 
change could be made catastrophically it 
would be well worth making and then 
proceeding to point out that as it would involve 
a of productive industry to 
meet the demand created by an entirely new 
distribution of purchasing power it would 
involve also in the application of labour and 
industrial machinery alterations which no 
afternoons work could effect you cannot 
convince any one that it is impossible to 
tear down a government in a day but 
everybody is convinced already that you cannot 
convert first and third class into second 
class rookeries and palaces into comfortable 
dwellings and jewellers and dress makers 
into builders and bakers by merely singing the 
marseillaise no judicious person 
however deeply persuaded that the work of the 
court DRESSMAKER has no true social utility 
would greatly care to quarter her idly on the 
genuinely PRODUCTIVE workers pending the 
preparations of a place for her in their ranks 
for though she is to all intents and purposes 
quartered on them at present yet she at 
least escapes the demoralisation of idleness 
until her new place is ready it is better that 
her patrons should find DRESSMAKING for her 
hands to do than that satan should find 
mischief demolishing a bastille with seven 
prisoners in it is one tiling demolishing one 
with fourteen millions quite another 
the strength of evolutionary or 
opportunist socialism is that under thin but effective 
disguises it is able to work itself into being 
while in the meantime those who would 
like to be its opponents are wasting their 
energies in cudgelling revolutionary men of 
straw set up for the purpose the success 
of socialism is no longer dependent on the 
ACTIVITY organising secretaries it has 
become a civic necessity and as the need is 
felt so it will be supplied by men who would 
be the last to describe THEMSELVES as ideal 
politicians the fact is that the trend towards 
democratic socialism is now so rapid and 
unconscious that we are in danger of 
forgetting the necessity under which we are placed 
of preserving the personal obligations placed 
by the author of nature on our shoulders 
may i suggest hut one albeit the most 
important of instances in point can it be 
doubted that if the late government had 
remained in power and had mr ALAND 
maintained his policy of repressing the voluntary 
schools the system of a state-aided school 
in which the children in time would 
necessarily be state-fed and state-clothed would 
take from the parents the last vestiges of 
their natural duties and elevate the 
board into a propaganda of morals and a 
dictator of that attenuated protestantism 
which is said to ho a part of EVERYBODY 
religion but which in its bold crudity 
represents the convictions of no one 
whatsoever 
the tend towards state socialism however 
is beyond dispute and as a factor it throws a 
weird light upon the way in which english 
practical men treat their convictions in the 
teeth of gesticulating professors of political 
economy despite the political power of

produced under immoral conditions on the other 
are the industrial ideals of the future that the 
work done for the communityand by the 
community though perhaps in some cases less

by the individual for the individual that 
while for the individual the finest life is that 
expended for the people so for the state 
the best government is not that which rules 
least but that which can safely undertake 
the most collective work i must be content 
if this paper has served on the one hand to 
suggest an approximation of socialism to 
general philosophical ideas and on the other 
that an examination of actual facts will 
AMPLY attest that socialism is no mere abstract 
revolutionary dream but only a principle to 
explain and help forward a course of 
evolution already in full progress

many adieus were signalled from shore to ship 
and from ship to shore at the last moment

was handed to us for publication in the

the captain and officers of HMS

from zanzibar at the termination of their 
commission of thanking the inhabitants for 
the many kindnesses and great hospitality 
they have continually received during their 
stay of nearly three years in these waters 
they have made many friends whom they 
hope only to say au REVOIR to and not 
goodbye and their one regret is that they are 
sorry that they are unable to make some 
slight return for all the kindness they have 
individually and collectively received but 
the shortness of their final stay at ZANZIBAR 
must he their excuse 
they only hope that this kindness may be 
continued to their successors and that they 
will find their stay at zanzibar equally 
pleasant 
we can only repeat our expressions of 
regret at their departure we published last 
week adding that we trust no further coast 
disturbances will protract the time between 
their leaving old friends in zanzibar and 
their meeting still older friends in the dear 
HOMELAND 

A 

within the past few days zanzibar has 
witnessed two natural phenomena which 
have exercised the native mind and caused 
exceeding diversion to the youth of the place 
on friday evening a total eclipse of the 
moon was the occasion of much drumming 
shouting and noise in general which had the 
desired effect of causing the moon once 
more to unveil its face and on sunday 
and monday extraordinary high tides 
caused these a from the creek to cross the 
MYOMA road flowing down over the bank 
in a very niagara to the distress of the 
golf-players and the serious delay of those 
bound for any SEAMEN even brave 
horsemen who essayed to cross the flood 
quailed as the rushing waters athwart their 
course threatened to sweep rider and horse 
off their feet 

the d A a l s s kanzkr which 
has been before the public of late as giving a 
perfect object lesson with regard to the 
promptitude with which the suez canal 
could be blocked for a time left aden for 
zanzibar on sunday additional interest 
has been given to the occurrence by reason 
of the fact that mr cecil rhodes was on 
board at the time on his way down to beira 
whence he proceeds to mashonaland and it 
is a somewhat strange coincidence that on 
his homeward journey he was subjected to 
accident and delay when on hoard the union 
oos s s moor 

of the penalty in this case will act as a 
wholesome deterrentthroughout zanzibar and 
PEMBA where although in each ease the 
towns which contain the governing powers 
are but as limpets stuck on rocks the talk of 
the bazaars will reach in process of time to 
the most distant recesses of the islands in 
which however we trust no such proceedings 
obtain any hold 

gradually ZANZIBAR communication with 
other places is being improved and if we live 
long enough we shall get all we want we 
are very glad to be able to announce 
that direct communication with natal by an 
english ship all the way is now about to 
be effected by the b i gos boats now 
running to zanzibar from bombay via 
ECHELLES continuing their journey to DURBAN 
it is to he hoped that all here who can WILL 
give the venture their support so that direct 
communication between these two places 
may be carried on in friendly rivalry as 
REWARDS comfort and speed between the ships 
of the line which has served us hitherto and 
the ships of the line which has served 
bar so long and is now emboldened to 
make this new venture 



general sir LLOYD MATHEWS with mr 
bomanjee maneckjee and staff left last week 
for mombasa to select a site and to

while the c s great northern is in 
harbour it has occurred to the friends of 
sport that we have the material for 
another of those regattas which invariably are a 
great success from the many 
bye-occurrences which servo AS diversions for those 
nor absorbed in the details of the race 
itself the shore is strong in sailing craft 
but so too we believe is the ship and we must 
not let slip out of sight that some time 
has elapsed since a certain cup crossed 
the water and that every occasion ought 
to he availed of for FACILITIES our ability to 
bring it hack across the water again 

we have never played to EXETER hall 
and we have no intention to do so though of 
course in surroundings such as we have here 
we have matter galore for the unpractical 
enthusiasts who gather together at that 
centre of sanctity and righteousness did we 
think any good would be done by publishing 
the same but there are times when to maintain 
silence is to fail in seconding the ruling of 
the law and the voice of justice and to 
promote the interests of humanity 
the case reported in our columns of 
cruelty of the most atrocious kind on the part of 
an arab owner towards a slave at PEMBA is 
we suppose the worst case yet reported and 
we should say mr donald mackenzie would 
have given much to have inserted such in 
his sensational account of atrocities at 
ba the arab who could go to these lengths 
has not arrived at that stage at a leap we 
believe we are right in saying that only lack 
of evidence has prevented his being indicted 
on still more severe and horrible counts but 
evidence is difficult to obtain at first hand 
the power of this arab in question was 
terrorising in the island even to the extent of 
his being followed about by a thousand 
armed men and dr sullivan the vice-consul 
of PEMBA SINGLEHANDED as he is without 
at a meeting of the zanzibar NICE SOLICIT

trial for 

supposed treasonable action 
a case of an interesting and unusual kind 
was tried in h m consular court last 
week commencing on tuesday and not 
concluding until friday a beloochi formerly 
jemadar at the fort in mombasa was 
charged before his honour judge cracknall 
sitting with three assessors viz mr 
w CAMPING KHOJAH salehmahomed 
THARIA and sheriff DEGREE with having 
carried letters from the rebel chief MUBARAK 
bin RASHID to h h the sultan asking for 
assistance in the form of munitions of war 
the prosecution was conducted by mr f 
h A wilson while the defence of the 
prisoner rested with mr hoshanji baburji 
who with no previous notice was 
requested by the judge at the commencement of 
the case to do his best for the prisoner who 
was at the time without counsel for defence 
the evidence was of a most conflicting and 
contradictory nature both sides flatly 
denying the statements of each other after a 
long and patient hearing in which 
everything was done to try and elicit the real 
facts and every witness called both from 
mombasa and here who could throw any 
light upon the matter the case was 
concluded by the judge reading a letter received 
FIBRA general sir LLOYD wm MATHEWS in 
which the general stated that the accused as 
jemadar of the jlombasa fort had borne 
a very good character and that he was one 
of the few beloochis who remained loyal 
at the time of the revolt of his fellow 
ASKARIS in mombasa after which mr 
HANNI baburji and mr wilson addressed 
the court his honour judge cracknall then 
briefly dealt with the leading statements 
of each of the witnesses and summed up 
the case for the consideration of the 
assessors after a brief consultation the three 
assessors gave their opinion unanimously 
that in view of the fact that no 
communication had been proved to exist between the 
prisoner and MUBARAK bin RASHID the 
evidence in fact tending to quite the 
contrary and that the prisoners behaviour on 
delivering the letters was not that of a 
man in possession of a serious and criminal 
message they did not believe he had a 
guilty knowledge of the contents of the 
letter his honour judge cracknall 
accepting and agreeing with this opinion the 
prisoner was at MUCO discharged 

the gross case of cruelty 

at PEMBA 

on thursday last before his honour 
judge cracknall an arab one ALI bin 
la of PEMBA was brought up to take his trial 
at the instance of h b m government on 
a charge of gross cruelty towards a slave of 
his one MUFTAT by name mr LASCAR 
conducted the prosecution 

the gazette 

march A SG 

march A 1896 

most residents here must remember to 
have seen with feelings of horror some months 
since in front of the AGENCY the prostrate 
figure of a man in the last stage of 
emaciation and starvation with two iron 
bands around his ankles driven deep into 
the flesh all round that part of the 
body was in a pitiably diseased state this 
was the slave MUFTAT rescued as was then 
thought almost too late from the barbaric 
cruelty of his master the accused and sent 
down to zanzibar by dr osullivan h b 
ms vice-consul at PEMBA for treatment it 
seems from the evidence given by the man 
that some months ago he along with some 
other slaves ran away and w as restored to 
his master the latter or rather his son 
la bin ALI with a refinement of cruelty 
fortunately now rare in our days punished 
him by having double irons welded on his 
flesh just near the ankles the irons being 
connected by a bar with a clove tree between 
the unfortunate mans legs this confined 
him to that spot practically in one posture i 
to prolong his misery and save him from a 
speedy death a COCOANUT was given to him 
morning and evening as food and drink and 
thus chained and thus starved the miserable 
man continued in that selfsame spot 
exposed to all the inclemencies of weather and to 
the ravages of insect life for seven months 
during that period the accused visited him 
but did absolutely nothing to help him in 
any way the slaves evidence in itself 
was not sufficiently strong to connect the 
accused with the offence as it pointed more 
strongly towards the son ABDULLA bin ALI 
but fortunately dr OSULLIVAN evidence 
substantially proved full knowledge on the 
part of the accused of the state in which the 
prisoner was during his confinement on his 
shamba another witness MAME fundi 
deposed to herself also receiving practically 
a similar treatment as MUFTAT and to seeing 
the latter chained in the way described dr 
osullivan said that acting on information 
nearly seven months after the slaves had 
been restored to their owner he found that 
MUFTAT was chained to a tree on the 
ACCUSED shamba that when he sent a rescue 
party the next day he found the slave 
gone the tree to which he had been 
confined having been cut down however they 
found him in a shed hard by which they 
broke open and he was taken to CHASE 
CHASE MUFTAT said that a day or so before 
lie was rescued the ACCUSED slaves cut down 
the tree he was tied to and shut him up in 
the shed where he was found every effort to 
remove the irons which had quite eaten 
into the flesh was futile and so he was sent 
on here where they could only be removed 
by means of specially constructed 
apparatus 

dr charlesworth deposed to the state of 
the slave when he first saw him and that he 
had been UNDER treatment ever since his feet 
being permanently injured he also said 
that a month longer of the confinement 
would in his opinion have killed the man 

this closed the case for the prosecution 
the accused was then charged he called no 
evidence but pleaded not guilty saying that 
MUFTAT was not his slave and that he had 
never seen him before 

the gazette 
the learned judge in passing sentence said 
that it was a case of gross and terrible 
cruelty and that although the son ABDULLA bin 
ALI seems to have taken the initiative in 
punishing the slave yet the accused must he 
held to be particeps criminis in that foul act 
extending over A months the tortures arising 
from which he could at any time have 
stopped the accused was then sentenced to 
seven years imprisonment with subsequent 
deportation from zanzibar and PEMBA and a 
fine of rs 5000 ive are glad to say that a j 
warrant for the arrest of the son is to issue

the italians abandoned their guns after 
the defeat by MENELIK army 
mr goschen informed the house that it 
was not intended at present to ask for docks 
at mauritius or SIMONS town but to ask 
for money for the preliminary surveys it 
was useless to propose docks until these had 
been concluded 
there is intense excitement in rome over 
the defeat of the troops in abyssinia the 
garrison is confined to barracks the 
ans lost OF guns three generals are missing 
and one wounded 

TH march 1896 

it is reported that the italian losses are 
between 3000 and 5000 men it is 
believed that general baratieri desired to strike 
a blow before he was superseded 

the italian cabinet has resigned 
later news states that the italians had 
fifteen battalions engaged general baratieri 
commanding them the SLOANS completely 
outmanoevoured the i ITALIANS and finally 
charged amid their ranks firing at the officers 
POINTBLANK the retreat was an utter rout 
the losses are not stated but a whole brigade 
under general dabormida is missing 

TH march 1896 

it is generally believed that the italian 
defeat will weaken the triple alliance and 
lead to a of the powers 
stormy scenes occurred at the opening of 
the rome parliament the opposition 
demand the impeachment of signor CRISPI 
during PARADING of the people in the streets 
windows were smashed many arrests were 
made 

TH march 1896 

serious demonstrations are taking place in 
home the republican tendency is all 
against the continuance of the operations in 
abyssinia this feeling is renewed in the 
CHIEF cities in signor CRISPI and 
neral baratieri are bitterly denounced a 
ministry with signors RICOTTA and RUDIN 
is probable 
the difficulty in solving the crisis is 
owing to the popular clamour to recall the 

the queen has started for CIMIER 
count a goluchowski the austrian 
ter of foreign affairs has arrived at berlin 
to confer with prince hiihenlohe on the 
situation especially relative to italy the 
koehmche zeitumj states that germany 
and austria are determined loyally to 
support their all 
the formation of the new italian cabinet 
is proceeding signor RUDIN is premier 
general RICOTTA minister of war and signor 
brin foreign minister the rest of the 
cabinet is uncertain 

the water-hate 

of the 

transvaal 

the increasing facilities of passenger 
service up the coast are doing much to unite 
the interests of british east africa with 
south africa and all that makes for it 
amongst many things which go to promote 
the unification of british africa not the least 
in influence will be found the stream of 
passengers flowing up and down touching 
here and there keeping up a living 
communication between scattered communities 
which are made thereby one in sympathy 
and interests the following very excellent 
account of juelagoa bay the meeting-point of 
south african and east coast life we take 
from CHAMBERS JOURNAL 
no commercial event of modern times has 
so strongly stirred the people of south 
africa as the recent opening of the railway 
from delagoa bay to pretoria the capital 
of the south african republic better known 
as the transvaal the president of that 
rising state had set his heart on finding to 
the sea a way that should be free from 
lish influence and removed from the fear of 
english control no means of securing an 
entirely independent port on the eastern 
seaboard existed and the only possible 
alternative was to employ the portuguese port 
of lourenco marques as the desired haven 
of the transvaal state 
the making of the railway line was 
attended with serious difficulties southern 
africa is roughly speaking an inland 
plateau with an average height of four 
thousand feet above the sea on the western 
side this plateau rises from the atlantic in a 
long and regular slope on the eastern it 
springs abruptly from the fringe of low 
COASTLANDS which lie between its base and 

troops and abandon the country the 
THREE SLOANS are besieging adrigrat 
china refuses the french syndicates offer 
of a loan although backed by the french 
government negotiations with an 
german syndicate are proceeding

reception and has reached marseilles on his 
homeward journey he visited the 
car invalids 
anti-senate demonstrations have been 
held in several places 
the budget committee has rejected the 
government income-tax scheme 
the colonial committee have voted the 
abolition of slavery in madagascar 
despatches from general baldessera shew 
that the situation is most grave he is unable 
to relieve ALRIGHT which is entirely sur 
rounded the place contains a garrison of 
4000 with only a months supply of 
provisions an army of dervishes threatens 
KASSALA which is garrisoned by 2000 men 
it is feared that the 2000 troops sent to 
succour this garrison have been intercepted 
general baldessera himself has reached 
ASMARA 
further details augment the gravity of 
the disaster one brigade has been 
completely annihilated after a heroic resistance 
MENELIK advanced no further after his 
victory he is said to have had 100000 men 
with him general baldessera has been 
authorised to withdraw the KASSALA garrison 
if they are endangered the rumour that they 
are surrounded is not confirmed 
the crisis in rome is still unsettled 
riotous PARADING against the war continue in 
many places 
signor RICOTTA is forming a cabinet with 
the support of signor RUDIN who probably 
will be the premier 

WITH march 1896 

general baldissera has telegraphed that 
the situation is not desperate he has thirty 
thousand men exclusive of the garrisons of 
the forts
