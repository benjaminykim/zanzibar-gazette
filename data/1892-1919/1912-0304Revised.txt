owing to the expiration of their notices a

coal strike mr david a thomas of the 
firm of messrs thomas aud DAVEY the 
MONIST of the welsh coalowners on being 
interviewed on tuesday regarding the conference 
govern i said matters remain exactly as they were in the 
morning nothing has been done the other 
prominent people on both sides are equally 
pessimistic it is now generally considered that a 
stoppage is hardly preventible whatever the 
result of the conference the miners everywhere 
are determined to insist on the minimum wage 
without any hampering conditions 

the liberal papers continue to declare that the 
government as a last resource should rush a bill 
through establishing the minimum wage they 
even suggest that the government should take 
over the mines and operate them on the minimum 

night with mr ASQUITH a coalovner m wage principle 

day 
being interviewed said that the situation as 
easier and decidedly more hopeful 

the owners and miners have had separate 

the times states that the government had 
submitted no proposals either to the miners or 
the men on tuesday but intimated that they had 
meetings with only a partition in between tie devised a scheme and had requested the miners 
two parties exchanged friendly greetings aid to appoint a committee to consider it 
bubsethere is a more cheerful atmosphere AFTERWARDS QUIETLY the ministers and this committee had a 
all the delegates from the miners FEDERAL 
n conference lasting three hours the government 
went to the foreign office and met mr asqnth 
are finding it difficult to induce the miners to 
conand his colleagues the president and 
sider their proposals 
president spoke on behalf of the miners 

the times correspondent in south wales states 

that the men in this district undoubtedly want to 
HIGH I the workers can hold out longer than it is 
supposed even if there is no strike it will be 
difficult to keep the mines open as arranged and 
to divert the local shipping to other ports 

the times further states that the miners in 
durham and NORTHUMBERLAND are in a 
comparatively good financial position and very 
determined 

the first rioting occurred at chesterfield on 
tuesday some miners who were proceeding to 
work were stoned and had bottles thrown at 
them this was quickly suppressed by the 
police 

fresh conferences were forced for last night 
mr ASQUITH has gone to the king in the 
meantime the scottish delegates in london have 
telegraphed to their districts for the men to lay 
down their tools the welsh 
men announce that they will strike 
anyhow thus rendering idle the whole coalfield 

when mr ASQUITH returned from BUCKINGHAM 
palace the miners entered downing street 
while the owners were still conferring there soon 
both the miners and owners proceeded to the 
foreign office 

it is understood that the english coalowners 
in the federated area have agreed to accept the 
government scheme including the minimum 
wage the NORTHUMBERLAND and south wales 
owners oppose the scheme while the scottish 
section is divided 

the miners are debating the acceptance of this 
partial settlement while negotiations with south 
wales NORTHUMBERLAND and scotland continue 
an official statement says that the government 
are satisfied that there are cases where miners 
cannot earn a reasonable wage from causes they 
cannot control that the power to secure such a 
wage should bo secured by arrangements as to 
the suitable circumstances of each district with 
adequate safeguards to protect the employers 
against an abuse of this power 

the government further proposes that there 
should be district conferences between the 
owners and the miners to decide on the 
minimum wage a representative of the government 
being present should any such conferences 
tail the government representatives must decide 
jointly the outstanding points 

a settlement last night was impossible but the 
miners and the miners were in conference till a 
late hour 

i he miners that there will be no 
settlement unless the minimum wage at the rate 
adopted by the miners federation is conceded 
therefore they cannot arbitrate on that point 
and decline to express an opinion on the question 
of safeguards they are still willing to confer 
with the owners the conferences will be 
continued

SAY it will make the decisions of its 
representatives at the suggested district conferences 
compulsory 

a section of of the owners for instance 
ham has accepted the government proposals 
on the grounds that it will be a national 
disaster if there is a strike but the welshmen are 
adamant mr thomas on being interviewed 
again yesterday said we wall resist the 
ment proposals to the end rather submit to 
compulsion than accept them voluntarily the 
miners are determined to remain solid and are 
confident of obtaining not only the principle of but 
a specific minimum wage 

one hundred and fifteen thousand miners struck 
on wednesday they generally are displaying a 
holiday spirit and there is an absence of the 
ill feeling of previous combats 

the leaders in derbyshire have issued a 
manifesto reprobating the outbreak at CHESTERFIELD on 
the STH instant 

a special cabinet council bas been called 
conferences took place at the foreign office and 
in no OF downing street between the 
ment and the committees of the owners and 
miners 

it is estimated that there already over 250000 

workers under notice 

it is understood that mr ASQUITH has submitted 
fresh proposals to the owners and the 
negotiations are taking a new turn they are to be 
continued 

the position last night was more hopeful as it 
was expected that the minimum wage would be 
obtained and the miners concede safeguards 
regarding a minimum output 

an official statement has been made to the 
effect that the NORTHUMBERLAND coalowners have 
agreed to the principle of the minimum wage 
but they cannot assent to it irrespective of the 
ability and willingness of the workers 

mr ASQUITH in addressing the national miners 
conference expatiated on the necessity and 
importance of the coal industry being carried on 
under proper conditions the government having 
recognised the principle of the minimum wage 
if it WAS not secured by agreement it would be 
secured by the government by other means he 
emphatically declared that it was the 
ments duty to do what it could to effect a 
reasonable settlement 

the government considered the matter 
without any class or party bias and it did not INTEND 
that what it believed to be a dwindling MINORITY 
of the employers should unduly delay the 
ATTAINMENT of this object which he believed the MIMUS 
had properly submitted to them 

the premier then made an appeal to he 
miners to allow a reasonable latitude in the 
DISCUSSION with regard to rates for particular wok 
a terrible responsibility would rest on the 
SHOULDERS of those who hindered in the achievement of 
a result so nearly within reach of attainment

case no OF of 1911 

re KASSA NANJI laianbankrupt 
the official receiver versus CAFFER HAIR 
air FRAME for the official receiver and mr 
mead for CAFFER HAIR 
order this is an application by the official 
receiver in the bankruptcy case re KASSA 
NANJI MINNI and co for a declaration that the 
payment of the two sums of rs 1900 and 
rs 1000 respectively made by gulamhnsem 
KASSA manager of the bankrupts firm to one 
CAFFER HAIR on the WITH and MUST june 1911 
constituted a fraudulent preference 

it appears from the evidence that one KASSA 
NANJI MINNI had for some years before his 
bankruptcy been carrying on business as a merchant 
in bombay zanzibar and other places 
HUSEIN KASSA was the manager of the firm in 
zanzibar 

upon the WITH june 1911 the firm stopped 
payment in bombay and on the WORD june 1911 the 
high court of bombay on a creditors petition 
adjudicated the firm bankrupt on the WITH 
august 1911 a receiving order was made against 
the firm in zanzibar 

now some time previously to the adjudication 
order in bombay CAFFER HAIR against cash paid 
to gulamhusein KASSA in zanzibar drew inter 
alia five UNDIS upon the firms bombay branch 
they were for rs rs 200 rs 500 rs 1500 
and rs 2500 the first three were dated RD 
1911 and were payable on demand in 
bombay the last two were dated respectively 
the TH and TH june 1911 and were payable 
respectively on the TH and TH july 1911 in 
bay in favour of premji CAFFER and haji LALI 
co 

it is clear that the stoppage of payment by the 
bankrupts firm in bombay on WITH june 1911 
was known all over zanzibar that same evening 
a number of zanzibar creditors thereupon tried 
to get payment from the firms manager in 
ZIHAR he meanwhile had received a wire from 
the bombay firm on the WITH june to the effect 
that the firm had stopped payment he received 
that wire on the morning of the LIST he 
however denied knowledge of the exact position of 
the firm in bombay and at first refused to pay 

the creditors here one creditor ISMAILI AMICI 
who asked payment of a dishonoured draft was 
refused upon the ground that he could not produce 
ins dishonoured draft 

among the creditors who pressed for payment 
was the respondent CAFFER HAIR it appears 
that lie went to the manager in the evening of 
the WITH and asked for payment of the five drafts 
which he stated had been dishonoured in bombay 
IJ thmfterl LEGAL proceedings if he was not 
paid i he manager told him to come later and 
he came again at pm when the manager 
gave him a HALALA for rs 1000 and told him to 
come AGAR CAFFER HAIR came the next day 
and at A pm the manager gave him another 
HALALA for rs OF these two HALALAS were 
ABOUT halt the amount due and were given bv 
thd manager to keep CAFFER HAIR quilt till he 
et RELIABLE information as to che position 
ot the farm there is some discrepancy as to the 
exact time of the payment of the HALALAS but i 
ACCEPT CAFFER HAIRS own evidence which is to 
tip effect stated above 

of the other creditors who applied for payment 
me were successful and others were not most 
the cash in hand seemed to have been paid to 
RETHA LILIA remtulla was refused payment on 
th morning of MUST june but CAFFER HAIR was 
pap the same day at A p m ISMAILI AMICI was 
used because he could not produce the

or even contended that the zanzibar 

OF 

the gazette 

march A OF A 

assets were sufficient to save the bombay firm 
in fact the event has proved the contrary the 
manager must therefore i think be taken to have 
known at the time he made the payments to 
CAFFER HAIR that the zanzibar branch must 
shortly go bankrupt in these circumstances a 
threat of proceedings against him was from the 
point of view of pressure more of a sham than a 
reality i would refer in this connexion to the 
remarks of VESSEL m b in e PARCE hall 1882 
OF c d at pp the pressure must be a 
real bona fide pressure here it was all a sham 
what pressure can be produced on a man who 
is going to become bankrupt in a week 
telling him you will bring an action against 
him it might be different if the creditor did 
not know the state of his affairs 

there are some further considerations some 
of the bills the two for bs 1500 and bs 2500 
were OF and OF days short of maturity on the 
WITH june 1911 and the first three dishonoured 
bills had not been returned to zanzibar in tire 
face of this it is difficult to see how the firm can 
contend as they do contend that the payment 
were made in the ordinary course of business o 
merely to keep their business going further 
where two creditors ask in zanzibar for payments 
of UNDIS dishonoured in bombay and the zanzibar 
MANAGER pays one and not the other it world 
appear in the absence of any real pressure brought 
to bear by either of them that the manager hid 
not only preferred one creditor to the other bit 
had been guilty of fraud in exercising the 
INFERENCE 

the suggestion of fraud is further EMPHASIZED 
by the fact disclosed in the evidence that whin 
the official DECEIVERS clerk came to go thrpudi 
the papers of the firm in zanzibar the TELEGRAM 
from the bombay firm announcing that they hd 
stopped payment was not to be found ALTHOUGH 
the file of telegrams was apparently otherwise 
COMPLETE the manager did not know where it ws 
it might he said have fallen out of a POCKET 
the original is still missing but a certified coy 
of the telegram was provided by the EASTON 
telegraph co upon an order from the court 

in my opinion the evidence shows that te 
firm by its manager not only preferred JAR 
HAIR to other creditors but fraudulently did s 
the respondent must REPAY the amount to ie 
official RECEIVER and prove in the ordinary vy 
for any claim he has against the bankrupts flu 
the costs of this application will be taxed cd

judgment 

this was a prosecution instituted by the poi 
under section OF b of the customs decree it 
against the three defendants I ALI JESSA A pc 

de costa and A COSME de SOUZA for contravening 
REGULATIONS OF of the customs REGULATIONS made 
under the decree of 1911 the first defendant 
ALI JESSA is the manager or chief clerk in the 
offices of messrs a m jiwanji co who are the 
agents for the clan ELDERMAN and harrison lines 
joint service at zanzibar the other two 
defendants peter de costa and COSME de SOUZA 
are tally clerks in the employ of messrs smith 
mackenzie co the landing agents in zanzibar 
for the clan ELDERMAN and harrison lines 
according to ALI JESSA statement it is by virtue 
of a contract made between messrs a m jiwanji 
co and messrs smith mackenzie co that 
the latter agreed inter alia to act as landing agents 
in zanzibar for the aforesaid lines as such landing 
agents they are to discharge cargo land and deliver 
the same to consignees and to provide tally clerks 
on the ships at their expense and to pass a 
receipt to the steamers for the cargo and to obtain 
receipts from the consignees 

as regards the first defendant ALI JESSA no 
evidence was produced as to the terms on which 
the acids in question were shipped or as to 
THEATERS of the contract between messrs jiwanji 
fc co and messrs smith mackenzie co by 
which the latter agreed to act as landing agents 
for the clan ELDERMAN and harrison lines beyond 
what is contained in the statement written by 
ALI JESSA and handed in by mr FRAME the 
discharge of the cargo is generally the joint act 
of the shipowner and the merchant freighter the 
latter beginning his part when the cargo is brought 
to the rail of the ship dick v APART 188310 
q b d 387 the general rule however may be 
altered by agreement of the parties or custom of 
the port of discharge per lord ESHER m b in 
BUDGET v BENNINGTON 1891 I q b at p OF 
although the shipowner undertakes by his contract 
to deliver the goods to certain indicated persons 
yet personal delivery may sometimes be excused 
by an established course of business at the port 
a delivery to certain other persons may by virtue 
of the custom be equivalent to the consignee 
himself in grange c taylor 1904 OF times 
REPORTS 386 it appeared that the practice 
was for the servants of the dock company to 
bring the grain in the ships hold under the 
hatchway whence it was lifted by elevator 
and shot into barges or put on the quay 
the shipowner paid the dock company for the 
work in the hold and the consignee paid them 
for the other work the elevator belonged to 
independent persons who were paid by the dock 
company as agents for the consignee and it 
was held that it discharged the shipowner 
the manner of delivering the goods and 
consequently the period at which the 
responsibility of the master and owners will cease 
depends upon the custom of particular places and 
the usage of the particular trades see BUDGET 
v BENNINGTON 1891 I QB at p OF now i am 
not told what were the terms of the bill of lading 
under which this acid was shipped was the 
shipowners liability to cease when the acids were 
delivered over the ships rail or was the shipowner 
by his bill of lading bound to land the goods if 
the shipowners liability ceased at the ships rail 
then neither messrs jiwanji co nor their clerk 
were responsible for the landing of these acids 
if on the other hand the shipowner undertook to 
actually land the goods then i consider that 
messrs jiwanji co and their clerk ALI JESSA 
must be held responsible as i have no information 
on this point i must acquit the defendant ALI 
JESSA of all liability for the landing of these acids

without having first obtained the sanction of the 
customs authorities 

as regards the defendant COSME de SOUZA the 
position is altogether different he is a clerk in the 
firm of messrs smith mackenzie co the 
landing agents according to the evidence of RICHARD 
PERCY GALER AND officer of the s s clan 
MENZIES there were two tally clerks belonoffia 
to smith mackenzie co on board but he DEF noll 
know their names he said that only one tally 
clerk c de SOUZA signed the receipt of cargo 
and it was only necessary for one to do so he 
signed in three places on sheet no OF produced 
in evidence there were OF cases of acids there 
and according to the evidence of the ships officer 
the tally clerk was fully cognisant of the fact 
that these cases contained acids as each case was 
plainly marked and he also informed him and 
on the receipt of OF casses of acids the tally clerk 
put his signature of this acid several cases 
were leaking it was deck cargo and is so entered 
on the back of the receipt and the tally clerk 
signed it and he knew it was leaking COSME de 
SOUZA in the statement handed in by his counsel 
mr LASCAR says as different cases of the 
cargo were being discharged into the lighter as 
usual i took note of the numbers of bales or 
cases with the manes on them on a piece of 
paper from which on my return to the office i 
copied the list in the book i produce neither the 
AND officer nor anyone else intimated to me the 
nature of the contents of the OF cases which are 
alleged to contain acids after the cases were put 
on board the lighter i took no part in the landing 
of the cases 

i cannot accept the statement of COSME de 
SOUZA that he was not aware that these cases 
contained acids acids are not like other goods 
they are carried in special receptacles and as 
deck cargo and not placed amongst the other 
cargo and the cases were plainly marked i can 
quite understand that in the hurry and turmoil 
of unloading a tally clerk might fail to notice the 
nature of each package as it came up out of the 
hold but these acids were in a different category 
from the other cargo they were deck cargo in 
plainly marked receptacles and as such they 
always receive special handling because of their 
dangerous nature but it seems immaterial 
whether the defendant did or did not know that 
these cases contained acids there was nothing to 
prevent him knowing and he certainly signed the 
receipt book on p OF in three places and therefore 
must be held responsible what i think the more 
probable story is that the defendant c de SOUZA 
knew that the receptacles contained acids but 
was not aware of the decree of october 1911 
prohibiting the landing of acids without first 
having obtained the permit of the customs 
authorities it was a new decree and had only 
been in force since october and the defendant 
had only been employed by messrs smith 
mackenzie co since november 

mr LASCAR on behalf of the defendant COSME 
de SOUZA pointed out that section OF b says 
knowingly contravenes and argued that if the 
defendant was not aware that these cases contained 
acids he could not be convicted of knowingly 
contravening the REGULATIONS that position 
seems to me to be untenable because it would be 
absolutely impossible to hold a person liable for 
anything if he has the opportunity of knowing a 
thing and does not take the trouble to avail himself 
these 
of that opportunity now suppose that 
disguised as 
acids had been put in some box and UIS 
marks indicating 
ordinary cargo either with no 

OF 

l 

t rat the box contained acids or described as 
s ME other goods then if the defendant had 
ALLOWED them to be landed he could not in my 
c pinion have been convicted under this section of 
knowingly contravening the REGULATIONS it 
i necessary that this prosecution should be 
i INSTITUTED by the customs authorities in order 
to bring to the notice of shipping agents this 
decree it is not necessary in the present case nor 
o the police press for a heavy fine to be inflicted 
small fine will meet justice of the case as 
i EGARDS the other defendant peter de costa no 
e IDENCE has been produced to show that he had 
a lythmg to do with the landing of this acid 
a id therefore the case against him is dismissed 
TORE concluding this judgment i might point 
it that in my opinion messrs smith mackenzie 
I should also have been made defendants i 
I ave not been able to consult all the authorities i 
u li VE 
ILKE to do because they are not 
AIRABLE but i will refer to one authority that of 
e queen STEPHENS 1886 l b I q b 702 
n that case it was held by three judges that the 
INNER of works carried on for his profit bv his 
gents is liable to be indicted for a public 
ISSUANCE caused by acts of his workmen in 
tarrying on the works though done without his 
knowledge and contrary to his general orders 
ins was an indictment for obstructing the 
NAVIGATION of a public river by throwing rubbish 
TO it mr justice MELLOW with whom mr justice 
hee and mr justice blackburn concurred 
SAITHE object of this indictment is to prevent the 
RECURRENCE of the nuisance the prosecutor cannot 
LOCKED by action but must proceed by indictment 
nd it this were strictly a criminal prosecution 
ould be met with the objection that there was 
o mens rea that the indictment charged the 
PENDANT with a criminal offence when in reality 
ere was no proof that the defendant knew of 
lie act or that he himself gave orders to hie 
VEN stilt at the same time it is nprpntm i 
ffstilfatth16 parti 
m the MENTAL FITS the capi 
the business which causes the nuisance and 
tis carried on for bis benefit although from ace 

OCULAR acfcheis barged 



he unable TO GO TO the paetffises 
the business is carried on for him by his sons 
fiat all events by his agents under these 
jcumstances the defendant must necessarily 
it lmcklenttoh r AND the BORITY 
wit is incident to the carrying on or the business 
is not because he had at some time or other 
en directions that it should be carried on so as 
j ALL the refuse from the works to fall into

MEN SAFI FOI dep0s1ing ifc that when it has

being rather straggly on account of the LEAFIT breeze 
the boats were led over the line by lotte 

the sultan and lulu gradually drew ahead 
after rounding the second BUOY but the wind 
changing enabled the pilot boat to catch up 
considerably the second round was rather tedious OWING

the suffragettes the militant members 
of this female movement it appears armed 
themselves with hammers concealed in their reticules 
then they assailed the windows of the shops in 
the leading streets of the west end in the busiest 
time of the day the shopkeepers and the police 
were taken by surprise and had no time to act 
on the defensive the wanton damage thus 
caused is estimated at several thousands of pounds 
sterling 

mistress PANKHURST herself then motored to 
the residence of the i rime minister and broke 
the windows there with stones one hundred 
and fifteen arrests were made 

mrs PANKHURST and the other leaders of the 
window smashing campaign have mostly been 
sentenced to two months imprisonment the 
police have estimated the damage at over 5000 
the public prosecutor dwelt on the disgraceful 
scenes of well educated and tenderly nurtured 
women breaking windows to further their cause 
he laid considerable emphasis on the fact that 
the time had come to inflict the maximum 
sentence of imprisonment those cases where the 
damage was over A were sent to a higher court 
to be dealt with 

coal strike it is stated in cardiff that the 
reason for the suspension of negotiations is to 
enable the mens delegates to obtain the views 
of the different districts on the subject of a fair 
days work guarantee mr ASQUITH is insisting 
that this difficulty should he satisfactorily met 
before he proceeds with his bill in the house of 
commons 

telegrams coming in from the coalfields show 
that the men are conducting themselves in the 
most orderly manner there is a prevalent belief 
that the strike will not be prolonged though the 
coalowners are not so optimistic 

as an instance of the paralysis already affecting 
trade twenty thousand workers were idle in 
glasgow on friday also a hundred thousand 
shipbuilders on the CLYDE will be idle in a week 
the price of bunker coal has risen in some of 
the continental ports to double the usual figure 
mr w e harvey the labour member for 
eckington on being INTERVIEWED said we are 
j not in a hurry like the kailwaymcn the strike will 
continue for a long time 

the great central railway has refused to give 
up coal in transit over their lines declaring that 
the company has statutory POWERS seize it for 
their own uses 

the radical papers on FRIDAY were 
acclaiming the victory of the men they condemn 
their great mistake in not accepting a 
compromise whereby they are the gainers and 
declare that the men are acting in disregard to 
to the national interests 

the effects of the strike are already beginning 
to he felt and are daily widening tens of 
thousands are idling in the various industries the 
docks and the trawlers are especially affected the 
prices of food are rising the strikers are 
showing excellent law-abiding qualities they have 
passed resolutions in some districts thanking the 
authorities for not sending extra police thus 
assuring the peacefulness of the speeches 
views with the ENGLISHMEN leaders indicate the 
feeling of the men that it was a mistake to reject 
the government proposals 

mr davies one of the miners delegates to 
london speaking at ebbwvale said that mr 
ASQUITH said something important which had 
hitherto not been published namely the day is 
not far distant when the government will make 
themselves responsible for a minimum wage to 
all workers of the country 

mr john williams the labour member for 
GOWER in a speech in west wales said that he 
expected a settlement of the strike on the TH 
march on mutually satisfactory lines 

in norway 20u0 workmen have received a 
fortnights notice on account of the british strike 
there is a complete stoppage of the scottish 
coalfields the NONUNIONISTS have joined the 
strikers the position is of the gravest nature 
part of the miners and go000 steel and other 
workers are idle 

the irish steamer service has been reduced 
german sympathy REUTERS agent at bo 
chum reports that the german miners 
TON make an appeal to the miners to desist from 
working overtime during the prevalence of the 
strike in england the members of the 
TIOU are proceeding to hold numerous meetings 
at the ruhr coalfield to discuss the 
wage question then to submit their demands to 
the owners whose answer is required by the TH 
march 

the vorwaerts states that the schichan 
miners at ELBING have decided by 3000 to 600 
votes to have a strike 

morocco REUTERS agent at casablanca 
reports that the french have been heavily engaged 
round the rebellious tribesmen at sukelarba 
many of the latter were left dead on the field
