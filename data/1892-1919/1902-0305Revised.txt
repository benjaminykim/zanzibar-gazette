naked and not ashamed 

the campaign of lying by pen and pencil on 
the continent has passed into that stage when 
the authors and artists no longer pretend to have 
the faintest EXCUSER for what they produce beyond 
envy hatred malice and an OVERMASTERING 
passion for boer money writers artist 
lecturers vie with each other in committing 
atrocities which they admit with a cynical 
grin are either prompted by sheer detestation 
of great britain or having been paid for by 
dr LEADS are supplied just in the same way as 
a professional poisoner dn the days of ancient 
borne would furnish any deadly drug for money 
the times is publishing a series of articles on 
the literature of german anglophobia which 
shows how even respectable journals associated 
with the names of great artists anti writers have 
poured forth the vilest slanders knowing them 
to be untrue the times observes it is worth 
noting that if one studies the genesis of the 
calumnies which have gone the round of the 
german press one finds that the pictorial 
calumny in most cases precedes and appears 
to have inspired the written calumny first 
comes the libellous cartoon and then the 
BOER commandant or the german volunteer or 
the letter from an anonymous teuton in pretoria 
promptly follows with the specific allegations 
required to corroborate the whole charge the 
artist manures the soil the writer as soon as 
it has been made sufficiently RECEPTIVE very 
difficult task unfortunatelyscatters over it with 
a generous hand his EVERREADY seed stock of 
lies we need hardly point out that this press 
campaign of unabashed calumny HAS not been 
confined to germany but has been and is still 
general on the continent amongst one of the 
most venomous of the dutch papers the NIEVE 
it otter damsche courant has earned disgraceful 
distinction and that delectable organ for some 
reason or other has explained that lying is dl 
in the way of business the editor seems quite 
astonished that anyone should have thought 
otherwise and his ingenuous statement throws 
a flood of light on the origin of these infamous 
attacks in the continental press of course we 
have been aware ever since they began of their 
true source but the callousness of the journal 
we have mentioned in owning up tor no 
apparent reason should surely enlighten even 
the dark mind of the average pro-boer in this 
country here it is in all its naked simplicity 
when we published accounts of boer 
WOUNDED and prisoners being killed at 
slaagfco it was at the instigation of the transvaal 
ambassador and from DISPURSE we were paid 
perhaps the transvaal ambassador is 
getting stingy but any way we find the journal 
still coming out with its inspired announcements 
is it asks the rotterdam paper in the article 
referred to discovery to and that lie dr 
LEADS is responsible certainly not but for 
cool impudence we never read the like of this 
dr LEADS is of course also responsible for

the peripatetic liars who are making revelations 
all over the continent they know perfectly 
well that they are lying but so long as tho 
money comes in it is all one to them one of the 
stars of this new profession is the unspeakable 
SANDBERG who at a parisian meeting attended 
by 4000 PEOPLE read a letter or what purported 
to be one from STERN in which 
he accused english soldiers of having on june 
A 1901 cannonaded a convoy of boer women 
who were escaping in carts loud shouts of 
a has les ANGLAISE death to england 
shame to the women-killers c greeted the 
reading of this letter there are no words with 
which we are acquainted available to describe 
the conduct of men who tell such infernal lies 
knowing they lie and glory in their infamy 
scarcely a shade less culpable is the conduct of 
the pro-boers who affect to believe them 

south africa 

europe and the united 

states 

the eagerness with which the SEMIOFFICIAL 
press of he continent is seeking to discredit 
loud ckaniiobnes account of the 
communications between the powers on the 
american war seems likely to defeat itself 
the americans with their usual good sense 
are not disposed to bear a permanent grudge 
against the governments and the peoples who 
misjudged the situation and espoused the losing 
cause four years ago they are quite ready 
as a distinguished citizen told our washington 
correspondent to be friends with powers who 
in 1898 were no friends to them but they 
know the facts and do not care to be taken 
for fools they know the facts better now than 
they knew them when this pithy summary of 
the situation was uttered for it wasjgiven before 
loud cranbornes reply to mr BORMAN 
nowhere as the american papers observe has 
any attempt been made to deny lord 
cranbornes narrative of what took place it 
is hinted however in various quarters that 
others powers were at least as friendly to the 
united states as great britain and even that 
it was not her action but the alleged action of 
another state which baffled the anti-american 
project we shall content ourselves with 
remarking that so far there is no evidence JU 
support of these contentions if it exists it 
can be produced UN il it is produced assertions 
as to its nature will not greatly impress impartial 
investigators into this interesting historical 
incident 

until that evidence is forthcoming the 
american public seem likely to remain 
convinced that england and england alone 
showed practical effective friendship to 
their country in the day of her trial 
neither they nor we pretend that our 
conduct at that time was dictated wholly by 
considerations of sentiment our interests were 
on the side of america and we had sagacity 
enough to understand that this was the case 

MARLI A 1902 

sentiment at the same time entered largely 
into our motives vv e were honestly glad as 
we always are to be able honestly to 
with the great people who inherit our language 
our religion and our manners we did them a 
service at a very critical time they recognized 
the fact long ago and they recognize it more 
clearly after LON d oeasboexes careful 
announcement they will recognize it more fully yet 
when the details of the negotiations come to be 
known they are not ungrateful as the tone of 
their chief journals and tho words of their public 
men sufficiently show naturally the powers 
whose efforts to injure them we thwarted are not 
anxious that they should learn the whole truth
