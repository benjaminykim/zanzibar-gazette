conferred by the section relates only to entries for 
the purpose of carrying out searches the word 
warehouses would seem to indicate that such 
was the intention of the legislature and further 
to construe the section otherwise would be to 
read itas inconsistent with a number of other 
legislative enactments y a j 

such enactments are JL article OF of the order 
in council 1906 and article h of the order in 
council 1897 which apply the code 
procedure to all persons subject to the 
jurisdiction of the BRITISH court A section OF of the 
police decree no A of 1908 whereby the detective 
inter alias is invested with all the powers of a 
member of the police force see king s 
TIN no A of the 1908 SECTION OF I and 
TONS OF and OF criminal procedure code 
by which any police offic r is timpqwerd without 
warrant to arrest any person who has been con 
cerned as the said SWEDEN had in COGNIZABLE 
offence and if necessary to demand free ingress 
into ANTEROOM or break down any outer or inner 
door to effect the-arrest and A sections of the 
zanzibar courts decree ko A of 1908 which 
applies the criminal code to all persons subject 
to the jurisdiction ofzanzibar court and 
therefore to the zanzibar police 

i think the true explanation is that the 
legislature INTENDED the fourth section of the decree 
no A of 1908 to apply only RESEARCHES and to no 
cases other than searches and even with regard 
to such this right is now conferred on 
the police by section A of the decree no A of 
1908 

for these reasons of OPINION that the 
magistrate was misled in MISREADING of sec A of 
the jurisdiction of the british court decree and 
that wilson had no right to refuse entrance to 
the detective 

another point was mentioned in the 
application but mr mead states that he did not ask for 
any variation of the magistrates order because the 
real object of the application for revision was 
not so much to obtain an enhancement of the 
sentence as to ELICIT a declaration that the 
police have in cognizable cases a right to arrest 
without warrant persons HQ are subject to the 
british court i therefore do not vary the 
MAGISTRATES order n 

i ought perhaps to add that it is quite clear in 
my opinion that the criminal procedure code 
except in so far IAS been varied by any 
decree subsequent to no A of 1908 applies in 
toto to the polieejforee and that sec A of that 
decree must be taken to have repealed sec A of 
no A of 1908 and section A of the kings 
TONS no A of 1908 which refused to extend the 
powers of the police under sections A and OF of 
no A of personswho were subject to the 
british court 

the result of the application therefore is that i 
vary the magistrates TINDING REGARD to the 
powers of arrest vested in the police in regard to 
persons subject to the jurisdiction of this court 
but under circumstances of this case do not vary 
the order

three issues have been settled the first is 
bv what law is the will to be 
after some argument it was agreed upon the 
authority of RASHID r sherbanoo OF b OF that 
the will of a KHOJA MAHOMMEDAN is governed 
forth e purposes of succession and inheritance by 
hindu law it was further agreed that the 
hindu wills act of 1870 governs the will and 
that according to the provisions of section of 
that act the will must be construed in accordance 
WITH the sections of the succession act therein 

mentioned and by whatever other principles of 
the hindu law of wills may be applicable to the 
ease that disposes of the first issue 

the second issue is what interest if any do 
MAHOMET premji and shukuru take under clause 
A of the will 

it is common ground that the single rule of 
construction in a hindu as in an english will is 
the meaning of the testator so far as it can bo 
ascertained from the document as a whole MAYNE 
hindu law TH edition p 557 now in clause 
A the testator purports to make WAKE certain 
immoveable property for the benefit of two persons 
sfcukuru and MAHOMET premji as the testator 
has used a MAHOMMEDAN word it would seem and 
it was so agreed bar that the MAHOMMEDAN 
law of wakf applies as far as possible this 
conclusion is supported by the remarks of lord 
justice turner upon the construction of hindu 
wills he says primarily the words of the will 
are to be considered they convey the 
EXPRESSION of the testators wishes but the meaning 
attached to them may be affected by 
surrounding circumstances and where this is the 
case those circumstances no doubt must be 
regarded amongst the circumstances thus OF be 
regarded is the law of the country under which 
the will is made and its dispositions are to be 
carried out if that law has attached to 
particular words a particular meaning or to a 
particular disposition a particular effect it must be 
assumed that the testator in the dispositions 
which he has made had regard to that meaning 
or to that effect unless the language of the will 
or the surrounding circumstances displace that 
assumption soorjeemony dasi v dinabandhu

ACCORDINGLY in applying the rules of construction 
for ascertaining the intention of the testator 
regard must always be had a to the habits of

now the testator in this case was a khoja 
MAHOMMEDAN who lived practically all his life as a 
MAHOMMEDAN in a MAHOMMEDAN country in using 
the word wakf he must have had in view the 
general meaning of the word as used in zanzibar 
there is no such word as wakf in the hindu 
law and i think the testator would be surprised 
to know that his will is in fact being construed by 
hindu law 

a wakf is properly defined in the MAHOMMEDAN 
law as a dedication in perpetuity of some specific 
property for a pious purpose there is in this 
gift no provision for pious purposes and the gift 
is therefore bad as a wakf nizamuddin GULA v

is no gift over as there was in anandrao yinayak 
v a g of bombay OF 450 the incidents 
annexed to the estate therefore appear to me to 
be the estate that the testator has 

premji the e be and the A 
BADLY you are o j r A ch 353 a 
KELCI case where chitty j in 
i refer to 
similar hut not in o an estate to a lady 
CASE A she the donee sold the 
WITHA bond JON 4hboieds were to be paid to 
estate part o nrjijears to mo that the 
other TFS ate a new kind of 
testator has a I the OWNERS the 
PROSTATE unknown LAWN h OWNERSHIP the 
perty las I JV the whole of the 
PRODS ib i DEBT 
SAYS if be owner sells a part only of the 
proceeds shall belong to her ic the owner and 
the residue shall go to other persons THE 
direction is i think repugnant and void 
present case though coming within the 

ARMS a452 there a transferred to b his 
share in a village b agreeing not to collect the 
ren s it was held that the condition in restraint 
OTBS enjoyment of the estate conveyed was bad 
A bein AGAINST public policy and in violation of 
HANI IN and OF ol the i TRANSFER of property 
act if therefore i am right in holding bhat 
mahomedpremji gets an absolute estate in this 
property it must I think follow that-the 
conations i have referred to are bad and so hold 

the remaining condition namely 
med preiuji should live with his mother my 
opinion good there is it is true no definite 
period of residence specified in the will and 
cases WIRE residence in a particular house is 
ACQUIRED it has been held that exclusive residence is 
not supposed to be intended the occasional use of 
the house and keeping an cstahlishmen m it with 
the intention of again using it as a r lecega 
sufficient compliance with the condition 
WENDA TAGORE janendra TANJORE OF w b DID 
bhobatarini r PEARY lai OF c 640 this provision 
however is not quite upon the samemogi g 
what is required here is personal LESLIE 
namely that MAHOMET proinji should reside with 
his mother in these circumstances it has bee 
hold that an occasional RESIDENCES not sufccien 
bhobatarini v PEARY lai OF c 646 at p BOB in 
such cases it is a question ol fact i think what 
constitutes sufficient residence 

tor these reasons i hold that in regard to clause 
b MAHOMET premji takes an absolute estate m 
the property therein mentioned subject only to 
the condition that ho lives with bhukuru his 

OUTCOME now to the third issue in the case that 
issue is what interest if any bakmabai 
take under the fifth clause of the i by that 
clause certain property is made wakf to bikmabai 
for her household expenses without words of 
limitation but with provision against ahehation ana 
attachment for debt upon her death the 
property is togo to abdulhusein alimahoined again 
without words of limitation but with sninlai 
restrictions upon alienation and stttachmeht i rom 
the authorities I have quoted it is clear that 
sikinabai is entitled to life INTEREST the 
property in question arid that abdulliusein a 
MAHOMET is after her DEATH entitled to the estate 
absolutely the restrictions concerning 
alienation attachment and enjoyment limited 
household expenses are all bad witmregard 
both the life interest and the remainder over 
no question arises in connexion with the ot e 
condition in the clause namely that SUKUR 

march A 1910 

the gazette 

should live in the house and pay rent at bs 200 
per annum i am informed that shukuru has 
vacated the premises and that all parties have 
agreed that no question is raised in this action 
with regard to that provision 

a further complication is raised by the fourth 

issue which is as follows 

by whom is the mortgage debt existing upon 
the self-acquired properties mentioned in clauses 
A and A of the will payable with regard to this 
point it is clear that the legacies are all specific 
mr SQUALI has contended that the gift of a life 
interest being partial gift of a specific whole may 
be demonstrative but i know of no authority for 
the contention a lease of land has been named 
by the legislature as specific succession sec act 
129 illustration d a rent charge out of a term 
has been held specific long r short p williams 
402 and a residuary devise of real ESTATES specific 
LACEFIELD v iggulden l r OF ch 136 see 
further william on EXOR TH edition pp 
hold that the legacies are all specific it follows 
therefore by sec 154 of the succession act 
corresponding to locke kings act in england 
that the encumbrance is payable out of the 
devised estates and not out of the general assets 
of the testator 

the costs of all parties will be paid out of the 

testators estate
