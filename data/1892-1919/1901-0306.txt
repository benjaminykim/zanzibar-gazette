QUEEN VICTORIA. 

AN APPRECIATION. 

The following “appreciation” of Queen 
Victoria’s character by one who knew her long, 
appeared in The Timex on the 2oth January:— 
A very interesting feature in the personal re- 
cords of Queen Victoria is the striking continuity 
of her character. It is almost astounding to 
find how closely and in how many respects she 
who died in 1901 as the aged mother of her 
people resembled the girl-Queen of 1837. Sixty- 
four years developed, but did not change, her 
•character. The sweetness combined with dignity 
which so impressed her Court at the beginning 
of her reign was reflected till its very close in 
her unfailing, loving sympathy and tenderness 
of heart. Her own Journal revealed to her 
people how great a part deep affection and 
devotion—love, in fact—played in her life in 
those days of which she has given ns the record 
■—love for her husband, love for her children, 
love for friends, love for places. Her heart 
was brimful of love; and the long years through 
which she lived never seemed to dull or exhaust 
it; nay, it seemed to expand and take in all her 
people. 

But equally continuous was her strength, her 
resolute insistence or. what was right. Indeed it 
has been whi-pored that that resolute assertion 
of her Boyal will and rights which the young 
Queen displayed in the case of the Ladies of 
the Bedchamber, and in the case of Lord Palmer- 
ston in 1851, did not fail to manifest itself in 
other less .well-known instances in which Ministers 
found that they had to deal with a very deter- 
mined woman. But this strength of will can 
only heighten the admiration which all the world 
has felt for the strictly constitutional limits 
within which the Queen moved. The true 
understanding of the duties of a constitutional 
monarch, and the resolve to observe them faith- 
fully, have in her case kept any instincts of self- 
will in check. A weak Sovereign might more 
easily endure constitutional trammels. The 
Queen, a strong Sovereign, not without a strain 
of peremptoriness in her character, must many 
ji time have been sorely tried by the trammels 
imposed on her Boyal will, but Ministers never 
had to complain that, directly or indirectly, she 
endeavoured to break through their toils. 

On the great ability of the Queen it is need- 
less to dilate. Men of all classes who have been 
brought into contact with her have borne testi- 
mony to it. But strong common sense was, no 
doubt, one of the dominant characteristics of 
her mind, which was clear rather than subtle. 
On many subjects she would take what may be 
described as a feminine view: on some, like many 
strong men, she no doubt had prejudices, but 
her opinions were always valuable and well- 
expressed, while her immense experience and 
wonderful memory gave her an advantage over 
nearly all the statesmen with whom she had to 
•deal. A reign of 64 years, yet the capacity of 

recalling all its main incidents vididly and clearly 
to the last ! 

It is very remarkable, too, and shows the 
breadth and the elasticity of the Queen’s mind, 
that she should have lived through such extra- 
ordinary economical, social, and political changes, 
and yet have been able to comment on the latest 
developments with freshness and understanding 
without the narrowing effects of retrospect, or 
of notions imbibed when totally different 
ideas and different standards of life and action 
prevailed. No modern reformer belonging to 
the latest generation of public men could take a 
deeper or more sympathetic interest in all ques- 
tions affecting the masses and dealing with the 
condition of the people than the Queen. 

No better index to the mental and moral 
qualities of the Queen exists than those utteran- 
ces in letters and messages with which the Queen 
has favoured her people collectively, or honoured 
recipients of her friendly sympathy individually. 
There Is about them an extraordinarily personal 
ring which makes them infinitely precious. But her 
pen had not only the power expressing sympathy 
and touching the deepest chords of a nation’s 
heart by its tender and womanly solicitude. It 
could express other matters very plainly. Her 
personal letters have been described as extremely 
vigorous, with mucli accentuation of important 
passages and bringing out into unmistakable 
relief points on which she insisted, and with 
little toning down of unpalatable truths if the 
occasion required that they should bo told. 

One personal characteristic of the Queen may 
not be very generally known. Her prolonged 
mourning and seclusion after Prince Albert’s 
death, her constant anxieties and heavy responsi- 
bilities, might be thought to have given a tone 
of permanent melancholy to her whole nature, 
But it was not so. The Queen could often be 
very cheerful, interested in all that was passing, 
conversing brightly with those around her, and 
not without enjoyment of humorous stories. 
The human element in all its phases was very 
strong in her. 

Much has been written about the family life of 
the Queen—a life almost patriarchal in many 
respects. Her own graphic description of her 
joys and sorrows in the days when her husband 
still gave brightness and gladness to her exis- 
tence will recur to all who have followed her 
personal history. And her own delight in joys 
of family life infused into her affectionate heart a 
very* tender and womanly interest in the homes 
and happiness of all to whom she was attached. 
Nothing could be more pathetic or more touching 
than her consoling, soothing words—free from 
all false sentiment and exaggeration, yet pro- 
foundly human—for those on whom sorrow' had 
fallen by the death of those they loved. She 
understood the depths of grief, the gaps in 
families, and would write as the friend who had 
suffered similarly herself. There was infinite 
pathos in her own life, and she felt with the 
truest insight what was pathetic in those of 

others. Never was there a simpler, more 
womanly, more human Queen, and yet a Queen 
with unrivalled powers of statemanship, and a 
real strength of character in which no King has 
surpassed her. 

MAX NORDAU ON THE WAR. 

HITTING THE NAIL ON THE HEAD. 

On New* Year’s Day there appeared in the 
Neue Freie Prcsse (Vienna), over the signature 
of Max Nordan, an interesting article on the 
South African war, in the course of which he 
says;—“We behold the rare spectacle of the 
whole world being at one in condemning British 
policy. We see a massed and terrible hatred of 
the English, who by many are considered no 
better than cold-blooded robbers and murderers. 
On the other hand, the British nation has almost 
unanimously declared for the policy of its pre- 
sent Government, with which it means to share 
the moral responsibility for the war. So con- 
vinced is nearly everyone in England of the 
justice of the British cause that I think, if we 
except Mr. Stead, there is not a single prominent 
politician or writer in England who would be 
ready to subscribe to another Gladstonian Con- 
vention of Pretoria. The unanimity of a nation 
like the English, in a case in which tlie whole 
world is also unanimous in condemning British 
policy, ought to make sensible men reflect; 
because the English, after all, were for centuries 
a bulwark of freedom. They are a nation whose 
sense of justice and equity is proverbial, whose 
high civilisation only a fool would deny, and 
whom to treat as a band of robbers and thieves 
is such an absurdity that only bad faith or utter 
imbecility could be guilty of it. Anyone not 
led by blind hatred, and with enough reason 
left in him to reflect, will find, in seeking for the 
cause of British pertinacity in this war, that 
England, is simply actuated by a very natural 
motive—namely, the instinct of self preservation. 
To understand this, however, one must know 
methodically the Boer had made their preparations 
for driving the'English into the sea; how, since 
the death John Brand, the Dutch of South Africa 
sought the means of driving out the English, 
first, by the illtreatment of the Uitlandcrs, and, 
at the right moment, by using force; and how 
tho motto ‘Africa for the Africans’ was interpret- 
ed to mean ‘South Africa for the Dutch, and 
there is no place here for the English.’ Other 
nations may be indifferent about it, but the Eng- 
lish are convinced that they must not lose South 
Africa. Not only is their territory there five and 
a half times as large ns Germany ; not only are 
there one million settlers of English blood or 
English speech, and space for a hundred times 
as many British settlers, but Soutli Africa is- 
still the most important station en route to India 
and Australia. Its possession in English hands 
is almost a condition of the possession of India 
and the defence of Australia. Its loss would, 
therefore, inevitably bring about the disruption 

And His Majesty doth strictly change and 
command, That no Edition of the Common 
Prayer be from henceforth printed but with this 
Amendment: And that in the meantime, till 
copies of such Edition may be had, all Parsons,. 
Vicars, and Curates within this Bealm, do (for 
the preventing of Mistakes), with the Pen, 
correct and amend all such Prayers in their 
Church-Books according to the aforegoing Direc- 
tion: And for the better notice hereof, that this 
Order be forthwith printed and published aud 
sent to the several Parishes; and that the Bight 
Reverend the Bishops do take care that 
Obedience be paid to the same accordingly.

of the British Empire ; and for this reason—for 
one, that is, which is at the root of all human 
relations—British policy must be what it is— 
simply the question—“You or I ?’ To those 
ii :;unanimous persons who ask why is not the 
j .run:la ‘You and I’ used, I would simply reply, 
‘Address yourself first to the Boers,’ because it 
was they who wanted to exterminate the English 
in Soiuh Africa, and, until they succeeded, to 
make at least helots of them ; whilst the English 
offer the Boers full British freedom, and as much 
independence as any loyal subject of the Queen 
enpys in the British Colonies. No Englishman 
ever thinks bf depriving the Boer of his place in 
the South Africa sun. There is no doubt that 
the South African undertaking is a terrible ordeal 
for England, and there is no lack of prophets who 
triumphantly foretell that it will be the grave of 
the British world-power. I am not of that opini- 
on, because England, under Elizabeth and under 
George III., had to face far more terrible dangers, 
and overcame them; and I am convinced she 
would rather spill the last drop of her blood than 
allow herself to be ousted from her present posi- 
tion in the world. And, highly as I appreciate 
the heroism of the Boers, I find the heroism of 
the English deserves just the same admiration.” 

should still have enough provisions to return to" 
wards Spitzbergen before winter set in. The 
point of the whole thing is that I intended to 
reach the Pole—I say I ought to get there in 
150 days, but I have allowed 180 for the purpose. 
If I leave Franz Josef Land when the sunrises 
this would still leave ’(allowing 180 days for the 
journey) ten days of remaining light for me to 
travel towards Spitzbergen. At the*expiration 
of this time I should put myself in winter quar- 
ters on the ice, kill the remaining reindeer for 
food and all the dogs not required for the rest of 
the homeward journey in the spring. By this 
means I should hope to reach Spitzbergen in 
the early summer before the breaking up of the 
ice. My arrangements are now all completed 
for the Behring Sea route, and will be submitted 
to Sir Wilfrid Lauricr on my return. I shall 
take with me from 12 to 14 men—all scientists, 
and none of them merely sailors or labourers 
I have already received numbers of applications 
from England, Canada, and the United States. 
Captain Bernier adds that lie attaches grea-j 
value to the use of the Marconi system in com- 
municating with his base. His plan is, of course, 
to stick to his ship, but he shall he prepared to 
leave her when necessity arose aud after reach- 
ing the Pole to return to her.” 

A CANADIAN POLAR EXPEDITION. 

Renter’s representative has had an interview 
with Captain Joseph C. Bernier, of Quebec, who 
is now in England in connexion with his proposed 
expedition to the North Pole. He has practically 
completed his arrangements in England and hopes 
to leave for Canada in a few days. Discussing 
his proposed journey Captain Benier said :— 

“1 have two plans to lay before the Canadian 
Government on my return, each of which are 
based upon my long personal acquaintance of 
Arctic seas and have been approved by the best 
Arctic authorities. My first plan is to start by 
way of Behring Straits, following the coast of 
Siberia, and enter the ice between 165 aud 170 
degrees of longitude East. I shall then push 
north as far as the ice will permit. When my 
ship gets into the ice I shall place myself in the 
hands of nature. If she gets into a better position 
than the track of the Jeannette I shall expect to 
reach the Pole and return in between three and 
four years. This will not be so difficult as in the 
case of the Jeannette because the Polar basin at 
the present lime has more openings than in past 
years, this being due to the changed climatic 
conditions. My second plan, which lias already 
been privately submitted to the Quebec Geogra 
phical Society, is to start from Franz Josef 
Land with a large number of dogs and reindeer 
and travel during the summer to the Pole by- 
sleighs, taking with me concentrated provisions 
and killing my reindeer day by day for food. 
Elaborate calculations have been made as to the 
number of dogs and reindeer required for sleigh- 
ing and for food. Travelling at an average of 
six miles per day the journey to the Pole should 
occupy 150 days, at the end of which time I

CLAIM Es. 10,000. 

The Plaintiff sued to recover from the 
Defendant Es. 10,000 being damages for 
personal injuries sustained through the 
negligent driving of the Defendant’s trolly 
by the Defendant’s servants in which the 
Plaintiff was travelling. 

The original suit was decided by the 
Learned Judge of tho East Africa Protect- 
orate Court at Mombasa, who found a ver- 
dict for Plaintiff and assessed the dama- 
ges at Rs. 1,000. From this decision the 
Defendant now appeals. 

JUDGMENT. 

In this appeal wo have no doubt that the 
Plaintiff suffered injury at the hands of the 
Defendant’s servants through the negligent 
driving of the ghuri in which she was 
travelling and which plied for public hire 
between Kiliudini aud Mombasa, we can 
have no doubt that the accident occurred 
from want of care on the part of the De- 
fendant’s servants when descending the hill 
near the Fort, and that the ghari was driven, 
at such a rate that it was not under pro-

March G, 1901. 

While upholding therefore, the learned 
Judge with regard to his finding that the 
accident was occasioned by the negligence of 
the Defendant’s servant, we order that the 
damages for the injuries sustained be reduced 
to Es. 500 and that each party pay their ow 
costs in this appeal.

per control and that by this negligence the 
collision occurred with some hand cart that 
was crossing the tram line. It has been 
suggested by the Defence that the Plaintiff 
refused to alight at the ticket station, the 
usual place of debarkation, and that us she 
had only booked to this point, she was a 
tresspasser beyond and therefore the De- 
fendant’s arc not liable. 

The evidence however, seems clearly to 
indicate, that the pace the ghuri was driven 
at prevented its drawing up at this point 
viz...the ticket station and that the impetus 
carried the ghari beyond it to the actual point 
where the eollisiou occurred. We are of opini- 
on that this collision occurred solely through 
the negligence of the Defendant’s servants 
and not by any contributory negligence of 
third parties, namely, those responsible for 
the hand cart which it has been suggested by 
the Defence was crossing the line and ought 
to have got out of the way. 

The only question that remains for us 
to decide therefore, is the “quantum" of 
damages. With regard to this we must 
consider very carefully the report of Dr 
Mncdonald on whoso medical evidence the 
Plaintiff principally relies. It appears that 
when she was examined by Dr. Macdonald 
he states in his report (written at a time 
when the whole matter would be very cleat- 
in his mind and well considered) that she 
' never mentioned the fact that she had 
suffered previously to the accident from the 
very complaints that she alleged to him 
were caused by the accident.

The French gunboat “Scorpion,” Capt 
Germain, of the Indian Ocean station which 
came in on the 2Gth inst., will be on this coast 
for some time. She intends visiting the 
German and probably . the B. E. A. Coast, 
when she will return and stay here till the 
end of the month. 

The Italian man-o’-war “Volturno" 
from Venice arrived to-day and exchanged

Amongst the arrivals by the French mail 
were, the Bevds. E.A. Gee and T.C. Simpson 
of U. M. C. A., Mr. and Mrs. Khiebel for 
Tanga, and Mr. Swinerd, assistant Collector 
of the Zanzibar Government Customs. 

Victoria Gardens.—On the first Wed-'

communities, it will be then continued. 

St. Joseph’s Cathedral.—During the 
season of Lent the Devotion of the “Way 
of the Cross” takes place every Friday 
evening at six o’clock at St. Joseph’s 
Cathedral and is attracting large congre- 
gations. 

Considerable additions have lately been 
made to the beauty of the Church iu the 
complete filling iu of the circle lights 
around the buildings with stained-glass, 
illustrating prominent types of Saints of 
the Church from primitive time to near 
“these latter days,” beginning with St. 
Gregory the Great in the one transept 
round to St. Aloysius Gonzaga in the other. 
A very fine canopied and pinnacled pulpit 
in carved African woods has been erected 
at the top of the nave, and is well worth a 
visit on its own account, as the whole of 
the work was executed in the workshops of 
the Mission in Zanzibar and was desiged by 
the Revd Fr. Kuhn of the Mission.

Dr. Macdonald’s report states, that she 
was suffering from internal trou ble which she 
attributes so/eli/ to the accident and that prior 
to her accident she was iu excellent health and 
suffered from none of these complaints. From 
the evidence of the doctor Eemet Ali who 
treated her before tho accident, it is clear w- , , ,, ., T , 
., , , ,, „ . ,. ,, 'West bv tho sea, on the .North 
that she was then suffering tor the very ! 
same complaints that she told Dr. Macdon- 1 premises o( the 
aid, had been brought on by the accident. 

And secondly all those valuable 
godown premises in the Town of Zan- 
zibar in the Shangani District now in 
the occupation of Messrs, Smith Mac- 
kenzie and Co., and used by them as 
Coal godowns and bounded on the 
by the 
Ice Factory, on the 
East by godowns of Messrs. Smith 
Mackenzie & Co., and on the South by 
a lane. 

We have no doubt in our minds that this 
was so, and that she tried to lay to the door 
of tho accident her former ill health in this 
particular. Taking all the medical evid- 
ence into consideration, we entirely agree 
with the learned Judge of the Lower Court 
in his estimate of the injuries sustained 
viz: a bad bruise on the forehead and a 
v.sry severe shaking. We cannot however 
agree with his estimate of tho damages, we 
think they are excessive for the actual 
damage sustained from these injuries, for 
the pain and suffering undergone and the 
extra expense that the Plaintiff has been 
pnt to 

Subject to a perpelual lease dated 
the 16th November 1874 now held by
