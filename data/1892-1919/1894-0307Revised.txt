OF 

message the position of all the europeans was most 
critical as it would inevitably create a great outburst of 
MAHOMETAN feeling and that mr RODDIE and myself 
must at once return to kampala captain MACDONALD also 
wrote that he meant to take advantage of the afternoon 
parade on the day following to secure the fort by 
peans and SWAHILIS and then call upon all loyal 
nese to move over into the old ZANZIBARI camp lie then 
intended to instruct MOGO to inform the mahomcdans 
at NAIVETE that if they desired peace LUMP and the 
IASI with two ot hers must be in his hands before night 
mid that incascofa refusal the protestant vvagandawould 
attack them the next day before any SOUDANESE could 
arrive to rein force them from port alice he added i hope 
these rapid and decided measures will save as but as 
you can see the position is most critical 
ately after reading this letter i realized our position 
TIC letter should have arrived on the evening of the 
WITH it was now noon of the WITH captain 
DONALD would make his first move in the game that 
afternoon doubtless supposing mr RODDIE and myself 
to have left port alice that morning according to 
his instructions the march occupied between seven 
and eight hours and wo had moreover a number of 
sick on our hands we could not possibly arrive un 
til late that night and in the meantime we should be in 
complete ignorance as to what had taken place at 
pala things looked ugly as we were surrounded by 
some 200 armed SOUDANESE and at any moment fresh 
news might arrive which would turn the tables against us 
at A pm we were ready before starting mr RODDIE 
went to SELIM bey and told him that captain MACDONALD 
orders were that he and his men were t remain quietly 
at port alice to guard the station as he had no intention 
of calling on them to fight against the mahorncdnns

TH march 1894 

her majesty has been graciously pleased to 
confer COMPANIONSHIP of the most distinguished order 
of st michael and st george on mr FENNELL 
rodd in recognition of his services whilst acting 
agent and consul-general in zanzibar during the 
absence of the late sir gerald portal 

RD march 1894 
the object of mr gladstones visit to windsor 
was to explain to her majesty his motives for 
resigning the premiership 
the queen accepted his resignation and has 
summoned lord ROSEBERY 

TH march 1894 
a large majority of the house of commons is in 
favour of lord ROSEBERY becoming premier owing 
to his able conduct of foreign affairs and his care 
for imperial interests 
the anti-Parnellites also support lord ROSEBERY 
imttheparnellites bitterly oppose him and the 
oucherians are in favour of sir w HARCOURT 
it is rumoured that if lord ROSEBERY becomes 
premier he will leave the foreign office and that 
either lord KIMBERLEY or earl spencer will replace 
him and that mr MORLEY will take the india office 
mr gladstone has a cataract in the eye and an 
operation is inevitable 
the french chamber has rejected by a 
majority of 284 votes mr bressones resolution in favour 
OUT an anticlerical policy the government 
advocated toleration whilst up holding the rights of the 
state 
LATER it is officially announced that lord 
ROSEBERY succeeds mr gladstone as premier 
the queen goes to london when lord 
ROSEBERY will have an audience 
a telegram from bathurst states that major 
madden with a west lidia column occupied 
SUMBAWA after a slight resistence the enemy then 
ATTACKED the village in force but were repulsed 
with heavy loss th british had nine wounded 
TH march 7894 
lord ROSEBERY has submitted his cabinet list 
to her MAJESTY 
lord ROSEBERY becomes first lord of the 
SURE and lord privy seal in place f mr 
stone and lord president of the council 
lord KIMBERLEY becomes secretary of state for 
foreign affairs in place of lord ROSEBERY 
mr j MORLEY having declined the post of 
PIPAL secretary of state for india it will probably 
lie offered to mr h fowler president of the 
local government board

london WITH february 1894 
an admiralty official despatch states that the 
enemy attacked the bluejackets at bathurst from 
cover whilst they were waiting for their boats all 
showed the greatest gallantry and coolness 
colonel majendie deposed at the inquest on 
dinthatin his opinion it was certainly intended to 
attack the observatory and that the explosion of the 
bomb was premature 
although persistent reports are still going about 
that mr gladstone intends to resign an 
authoritative statement was made last night to the contrary 
a large body of fodisilahs invaded BRITISH 
territory yesterday but were repulsed with a heavy loss 
after two hours fighting by a force consisting of the 
west india regiment and marines three of the 
british were wounded 

EST march 1894 
despite the denial authoritative the papers still 
continue to DISCUSS mr gladstones probable 
resignation the daily news designates lord 
VERY as the future premier with sir win HARCOURT 
as leader of the house of commons the radical 
papers are divided in their opinion some favouring 
NJORD ROSEBERY others objecting to a peer being 
MINER 
mr gladstone had an audience with the queen 
yesterday and it is generally reported that it was for 
the purpose of resigning but this was denied last 
night 
a great sensation HAS been caused by a statement 
iii the italian chamber made by signor CRISPI 
declaring that the conspiracy to cause a revolution in 
sicily was hatched in france the conspirators 
relied on the outbreak of a continental war initiated by 
russia to whom to it was intended to cede a sicilian 
port the rising was fixed for the middle of 
BRIARY but the italian government having heard of 
it frustrated their plans

the main roads from the palace up to the

illuminated on friday last in honor of the 
anniversary of the state entry of HH the 
tana to the town palace a hand performance 
was given during the evening in the sultans 
garden on the nazi-moa road and also a 
firework display a large number of residents 
including ladies being present 

the news which reached us through REUTERS 
agency on the AND inst that her majesty 
the queen haseonfered the honor of a 
LIONSHIP of the most distinguished order of 
st michael and st george upon mr FENNELL 
rodd in recognition of his service whilst 
ting agent and consul general here during 
the absence of the late sir gerald portal 
has been received with sincere pleasure by 
residents of every nationality whose 
appreciation of mr FENNELL ROADS work in 
bar is too WELLKNOWN to need any further 
reference on our part we therefore join in 
the congratulations due to mr rodd on this 
occasion and trust that this is hut the first of 
many honours in store for that gentleman in 
his diplomatic career 

we congratulate mr e giles 
ent of the eastern telegraph company upon 
the honour which was received by HAIN

samples of both wheat and barley grown on 
the kikuyu plateau in british east africa 
have reached london and in mark-line 
THIEVERY highest opinion is expressed of the 
quality of both samples this is especially the 
case with reference to the barley which has 
been declared to be as fine a sample as has 
ever been shown in the market the kikuyu 
plateau is on an average from 5000 ft to 
7000 ft above sea level and is one of the 
regions which captain LUGGARD refers to as a 
probable field for european occupation although 
SITUATED within the tropics as compared with 
kyassaland it has several advantages as a 
graiuproducing region not the least of which 
is that while the part of the lake NYASSA region 
most readily available for cultivationthe 
shire highlandsis a succession of hills and 
valleys on the kikuyu plateau there is a 
stretch of country 400 miles long which is 
nowhere below 5000 ft above SEALEVEL of 
course nothing can be done to develop this 
great grain-growing region until cheaper 
modes of transport are introduced and the 
advocates of a railway from mombasa to the 
victoria STANZA are especially pleased at the 
result of the experiment of growing wheat 
and hurley in a district through WHICH the 
projected line would pass it is possible that 
samples of this wheat and barley may be on 
view at the meeting of the royal 
cal society next monday evening when dr 
gregory of the british museum is to read a 
paper on his ascent of mount BENIA and his 
journey in east africacift leader 

ATLI MARLI 1894 
a REUTERS telegram from cape town dated 
jan OF SANSON monday in the presence 
of a brilliant gathering at admiralty house 
simonstown lady LOCH presented to lieut 
p v LEWES of her MAJESTY ship blanche 
the distinguished service order conferred 
upon him by the queen for his services on 
the juba river in rescuing last august some 
englishmen officials of the british east 
africa company who were being besieged by 
mutinous SOMALIS 

on the sunday before the mail left the 
italeiytis cutter met with an accident whilst 
sailing off the shore in a hard gale when 
between the blanche and her own ship she 
capsized in a squall the blanche instantly 
manned boats which with those of the 
raleigh besides the steam launch of the 
DOPE were soon on the spot a slight delay 
being caused by all the boats being at the 
davits on account of the wind the blanche 
boats were first in the water and her cutter 
under command of lieutenant LEWES was 
first to reach the spot her gig could not face 
the weather and her people were considered 
fortunate to get hack to their ship without 
themselves requiring assistance the cutters 
crew worked bravely against wind and waves 
and bad taken several men on board when 
another swimmer was found to be sinking in 
spite of tremendous efforts at the oars the 
boat seemed to get no nearer and it seemed 
as if the man must he lost as he began now 
to go under but after a supreme effort on 
the part of the boats crew they brought her 
near enough to be able to reach the drowning 
man with a boathook which he managed to 
hang on to until hauled into the boat 
tenant HUTCHINSON blanche and some 
bluejackets went to the rescue of the RALEIGH 
other cutter which by this time had 
drifted so near the beach as to he herself in 
danger the pinnace was in time and towed 
her to the flagship and the swamped boat 
soon drifted ashore 

referring to our recent extracts from the 
times of ceylon re the barque GROSVENOR 
sentences have been pronounced in the 
various cases the several members of the crew 
charged with refusal to obey the captains 
orders have been sentenced to terms ranging 
from A to A weeks each notice of appeal 
being given and in the case of assault a 
sentence of A months rigorous imprisonment 
was imposed

shes of FREEHOLD and laverstoke united for 
ecclesiastical purposes have had another place of worship 
and a new church is now being built thus the 
old edifice has become practically a private chapel 
surrounded however by a small public burying-ground 
it is charmingly situated within the park of 
stoke house noble chestnuts sheltering and 
overshadowing its rough walls quaint roof and ancient 
wooden steeple around the little enclosure which 
forms the burial-ground stretches an expanse of 
undulating PASTURELAND and so secluded is the 
situation that no roadway leads to the LYCHGATE and 
save a glimpse on a near eminence of laverstke 
house no habitation is in sight the interior of 
the little chapel is beautiful and interesting around 
the walls are many memorials of the portal family 
the tiny windows are filled with stained-glass 
rafters ARE of ancient oak and on the CROSSBEAMS are 
texts in old-fashioned ecclesiastical characters 
situated on a higher level than TIME nave the 
chancel is reached by a double flight of white stone 
steps the portal vault being underneath the chancel 
protected by massive doors and reached by a short 
stair from the nave having been conveyed from 
london on monday afternoon the coffin was placed 
on a bier in front of the vault at the top of the 
coffin of unpolished oak with brass mountings and 
bearing the inscription sir gerald herbert portal 
KCMG and gb born 1858 died WITH jan 
1894 was placed the widows wreath and at the 
foot was that sent by his royal highness the 
prince of wales as a mark of sincere regard and

the matabele war 

captain the hon c j white and captain 
c h w donovan who have just arrived from the 
seat of operation in MATABELELAND have 
communicated to a representative of REUTERS agency an 
interesting and detailed account of the fighting which 
resulted in the overthrow of LOBENGULA captain 
the hon c j white of the TH royal fusiliers 
who MS been for the last three years in the 
employment of the chartered company and during the 
last year in command of their police is a younger 
brother of lord annaly now in the scots guards 
during the late matabele campaign he commanded 
the scouting parties of the combined salisbury and 
victoria columns captain c h w donovan 
of the army service corps who was formerly in 
the TH dragoon guards was on a hunting 
expedition in mashonaland when he heard from natives 
of an attack on victoria by the matabele he gave 
very little credence to its because of the extraordinary 
stories told by the natives and as he could have no 
communication with victoria he continued his 
shooting expedition intending to return to england at the 
latter end of october when approaching victoria 
however he heard that the chartered company 
had ordered every man in the outlying districts 
to come in to defend the town he happened to 
be near the ZIMBABWE ruins at the time and as 
the COMPANY FORCES were going forward he 
considered it incumbent upon him as a british officer to 
lake bis share with his fellow-countrymen in what 
appeared to him the very difficult and arduous task 
which they were undertaking captain donovan 
was attached to the artillery of the victoria 
LUMEN under captain LEVITY captain white states 
as follows 
about the beginning of july 1893 i was in 
command of the COMPANY police at salisbury 
and on the WITH or WITH dr jameson left 
bury and went to victoria while be was away 
rumours became current of matabele being on the 
border close to salisbury in addition to those that 
were in evidence at victoria and i was despatched 
to find out about them I went with a patrol of 
police and found that the matabele were not up at 
salisbury and really never came there about the 
end of august I went down to victoria to dr 
jameson with some more of my police about lo 
picked men and interpreters when I got to 
ORIA dr jameson sent me to the border as he 
heard tbematabcle were there and wished to find out j 
exactly what they were doing i remained on the 
border for about four weeks and during that time j 
found that the MATABELE were there in considerable j 
numbers and that they were raiding and driving j 
off cattle from mashonaland this was after the 
victoria collision which took place about the 
middle of duly i ordered my police to follow up the 
spoor of these cattle and this took them to a kraal 
on the border where they demanded to see the 
INDUNA but the latter refused to come and speak to 

the gazette 

j them the police stayed there some time vainly 
waiting for bis appearance and were eventually 
fired upon by the natives the police returned the 
I fire and drew off from the kraal about 1000 yards 
when they saw about OF matabele clearing away 
from the kraal i reported this matter to dr 
j sonialso the presence of a large number of matabele 
on the border on the BOTH of october the victoria 
column in which myself and my men were now 
incorporated started to work along the border 
KEEP ing in touch with the MATABELE who were working 
i through cbilamanzis country and indaimas 
COUNT try about the WITH or OF th of october we got in 
touch WILLI THE salisbury column at THANA 
mba iron mine hill and the scouts then bad 
j their first brush with the matabele near INDIAMAN 
mountain the salisbury column also came in 
contact with the natives and it was at this time 
that captain campbell was killed while chasing 
two or three natives round the rocks there were 
two IMPRISON the matabele who kept going along the 
border and driving away the cattle with them as 
they went two or three days after this the two 
columns started together for BULAWAYO headed by 
their united scouts we still had news of these 
impis and still kept touch with the matabele 
information being gained from friendly natives and from 
our own scouts a few MATABELE scouts were seen 
from time to time 

about OF miles from iron mine hill we came 
across a mashonawho had been wounded just a few 
hours before whilst carrying grain with other 
SHONAS to the column he staled that the reason 
the matabele had fired upon him and his 
companions was that on being asked they were doing they 
replied that they were taking grain to the white 
men so far the various chiefs had brought us 
grain and cattle for the column we now for the 
first time got news as to the exact position of the 
kraal of the insukomini regiment with which wc 
had had our first brush near indaimas mountain 
up to this point we had been going more or less 
through bush but it was not thick and we kept in 
the open as much as possible but whatever might 
be the character of the country we found that the 
enemy kept moving just on our left flank and 
during this time were raiding and burning villages of 
the MASHONAS and taking away their cattle the 
country was very hilly and almost impossible for 
mounted men to work in at this point viz OF 
miles from iron mine hill the enemy for the first 
time crossed our front as we found by their spoors 
and now we began to get into the open country 
called the GWELO flats after leaving iron mine 
hill we had kept along the water of the rivers 
ZAMBESI and limpopo thus keeping on the high 
round and though this was a circuitous route it 
avoided all the difficulties attendant upon crossing 
rivers or entering mountain passes and thus 
proved a saving of time following this ridge the 
column reached the source of the GWELO river about 
OF miles from THANA INTIMA captain GWYNEDD 
williams was sent forward and came back with the 
information that the natives were at the insukomini 
kraal about OF miles to the NORTHWEST captain 
williams in performing this duty rode go odd miles 
out and back starting from camp at about noon and 
returning at OF pm taking about OF men with 
him a VERY smart bit of riding he had during j 
this time thoroughly reconnoitred the kraal major 
FORBES sent out a force that evening to surround 
the kraal by daybreak and attack the regiment I 
was not with that force but captain donovan went 
with them 

captain donovan STATES first intimation 
that anything was contemplated was about ten o i 
clock at night I was asleep under the waggon and 
was awakened by hearing some of mir men talking j 
quietly and heard that they were to get up and 
die their horses i was a attached to the maxim 
guns and I asked what was going on captain j 

ATLI march 1894 
LEND said they were going out to attack a kraal 
in the morning and after asking permission to go 
got a horse and went off we started about eleven 
oclock on a dark night the distance before us 
being as wc were told about OF or OF miles a 
followed a kaffir path through some VERY thick 
bush at one time a body of us lost touch with 
the leading part of the column and had to halt for 
about OF minutes or so looking for the road this 
was about one in the morning and in about an hour 
later wc crossed a small river the salisbury parr 
of the column which was in front went over one 
drift and the victoria section over another to save 
time in the dark when we got over we lost touch 
with the salisbury column who were about half a 
mile away from us and were unable to find them in 
the bush captain FITZGERALD went forward hut 
very shortly came hack and said lie had ridden 
right into an WRNPC who were evidently running 
away captain FITZGERALD was in charge of the ko 
I troop of the victoria column we came up to 
the kraal about half an hour after sunrise and saw 
that there was a river running on each side of it 
major WILSON who was in charge of the whole 
column divided it into two parties one under 
tain HEAVY was to attack the enemy on the left 
and the other of which lie WASN charge was to attack 
them in the front the party on THEFT had orders 
not to fire until major wilson fired one shot as a 
signal we advanced keeping well under cover 
on the other side of the river and captain LEND 
put the maxim gun on an anthill commanding the 
kraal several rounds being fired by the salisbury 
maxim and there being no response from the kraal 
the cease fire was sounded advancing into the 
kraal we found that it was deserted nothing being 
left in it but one or two old sick cows we went 
all round the place and observed that there was a 
splendid formation for gold in fact a reef ran right 
through the kraal which was on the borders of the 
samabuln forest the huts were beautifully clean 
and the floor of one was so brightly polished that 
you could almost have seen your face in it there 
was an enormous quantity of grain which was very 
acceptable for our horses we went down to the 
river offsaddled had some breakfast and waited 
there for about an hour all of us loaded up our 
horses with grain for their consumption on the road 
back j may here mention the great care even 
tenderness with which our men treated their horses 
after a halt of about a couple of hours we saddled up 
again to return and burnt the military kraal as 
soon as we set it on fire we heard a roar go up from 
the hills on the left which showed that the people 
who had deserted the kraal had been lying there 
watching us the whole time we reached camp about 
sundown that evening many of the horses being so 
knocked up from the hard march that many of the 
men had to walk and lead their horses our force 
consisted of men taken from each column and was 
150 strong we started on the night of october OF 
burnt the kraal on the AND and returned to camp 
on the evening of the AND the kraal is about OF 
or OF miles from BULAWAYO NORTHEAST major 
son was in command of the column and we had three 
maxims two on carriages and one pack 

captain white continued during these 
operations the column had moved forward about eight 
miles the average days march was OF miles and 
the column was now within three miles of the end of 
the samabula forest the impi had gone off to the 
west the next day about the AND the column 
moved forward and passed through the end of the 
samabula forest which is there very narrow only 
about a quarter of a mile through wc came out 
into the open again that morning there WITS a fog 
we found out afterwards that the insukomini 
ment with others had the intention of attacking us 
whilst passing through this end of samabula forest 
hut it seems that they missed us owing to the fog 
the column that day made two treks one in the 

ATLI march 1894 
morning and one in the evening whilst halting at 
midday the scouts went on in order to find out how 
far the SHANGAN river was ahead AS wc had 
information that the matabele were there waiting to attack 
us soon after leaving camp we came upon some 
matabele who were trekking across our front in the 
direction of the insukomini kraal and were evidently 
part of the big impis our scouts had a small 
engagement with them killing seven after this the 
scouts found four big deserted CHIRMS where a large 
body of MATABELE had evidently just been camped 
there being the skulls of OXEN lying about and the 
fires still smouldering it HAS since turned out that 
this body of men belonged to the insukomini 
ment and others who had been waiting to attack us 
hut had luckily missed our column owing to the fog in 
the morning and the quick rate at which we were 
travelling and they had trekked backed to the 
DOMINI kraal passing on our right flank and to our 
rear and returned to their kraal having received 
information that the kraal had been burned they 
evidently thought that the remainder of the column 
had not advanced but had remained at the GWELO 
river eight miles in the rear as a force of white men 
had gone to their big kraal and burnt it and this a 
native would consider a big undertaking in itself for 
one day this body of MATABELE was about 4000 
strong and they did not understand our column 
moving so quickly it had evidently put them out in 
their calculations we had been playing a game of 
hide and seek in the fog which in the morning had 
been very dense the column then trekked in the 
afternoon close up to the place where the 
ABOVEMENTIONED CHIRMS were CHIRMS are formed out of the 
branches of trees which are cut down and made into 
a circular fortification as in the soudan ZEREBA the 
next morning early about four oclock captain 
williams the hon m GIFFORD mr BURNETT mr 
PAGET and others went forward again to try and 
discover how close the SHANGAN river was that 
morning also there was a fog and the party lost their 
way FORAMEN the fog cleared and we were trekking we 
found captain williams party about three quarters 
of a mile off on our left trying to signal to us with the 
heliograph captain williams said by signal he was 
going on to the SHANGAN as soon as the fog had 
cleared and he reached this river about MIDDAY this 
was on the23rd thedayon which burnettwas shot

among the sofas 

one of the few europeans who have come in 
contact with the SOFAS frenchman who 
passed several weeks among them barely two years 
agosends us the following notes on these 
scourges to free the regions of the upper niger 
from whom is the object of the expedition which 
HAS just had the misfortune to be attacked by the 
french by mistake 

the explorer traversing the countries of the 
upper niger such as AMISS HOUSE koukomna 
ITC which ARE situated on the anglo-french 
frontier is quickly led to a curious conclusion to 
form an approximate idea of the state of things 
in those regions he must carry himself hack to the 
middle ages hut solely as regards the coarse 
brutal and rudimentary features of the social 
institutions of that period without any trace 
literature or art 
at the top of the social scale is the ALMATY or 
king at the bottom the bondsman or slave who 
is none other than the serf of feudal times like 
the gens de POESIE or villeins the bondsman is 
liable to he taxed at discretion from head to 
foot cultivates the soil in the plain and the 
harvest over he carries it to the tutu installed on 
the HEIGHTS agglomeration of four or five large 
huts surrounded by high walls of stone or of pise

critical hours of WARRAND they ARE frequent among 

A 

the gazette 

the blacksthe bondsmen scattered in the pla111 
are warned and come to take refuge behind the 
walls of the tutu and to defend it 
moreover between the freemen and the 
bondsmen even a trace of the corporations with their 
spirit of caste and their privileges is to be 
recognized under the name of griot we discover the 
troubador himself finally the sofas complete 
this mediaeval atmosphere they represent indeed 
nothing else than those hands of marauders 
mercenaries and reiters who devastated europe before 
the WITH century and under pretext of religious wars 
pillaged and killed papists and huguenots alike 
foreigners belonging to no country they dashed 
impetuously along the HIGHROADS sowing terror and 
desolationpitiless conquerors 
such are the sofas do you wish for a picture 
of their settlement at salliaya the capital of HOUSE 
a little kingdom near the english colony OF sierra 
leone rather read again the chapter which 
RIMES in his chronique du REGIE de charles ix 
has entitled les RETIRES 
whilst some groomed their horses which were 
tethered to the wall others made up the fire 
turned the spits and busied themselves with cooking 
the unhappy innkeeper cap in hand and a tear in 
his eye surveyed the scene of disorder of which his 
kitchen was the theatre he saw poultry-yard 
destroyed and his cellar pillaged and the worst was 
that there was no compensation to expect it is a 
wellknown fact that in that unhappy time in 
peace as in war a troop of soldiers always had free 
quarters wherever it might he 
substitute native for innkeeper and there is 
not a comma to he changed in that description it is 
exactly the life which those black marauders lead in 
the capital of HOUSE sisseke their principal chief 
in that country had installed himself in the 
agglomeration of huts which forms the royal palace 
the king of HOUSE himself wretched and in rags 
was reduced to begging in the streets of his former 
capital 
the sofas have as their supreme master the 
POTENTATE of the right hank of the nigersamory 
who strives to urge them to the conquest of the left 
bank having failed in the north near senegal 
where colonel archinard and the expeditionary 
corps of the upper river have beaten him again 
and again he has attempted an opening in the 
south near the borders of sierra leone and has 
intrusted the command of this attempt to kemoko 
BIALI his best lieutenant 
samory is one of those SOUDANESE conquerors 
like TIENA king of sikosso who in a few years 
found empires of considerable superficial extent 
thanks to the terror which they inspire by reason 
of the sanguinary character of their campaigns 
they thus succeed in collecting under their 
authority fairly numerous populations but their 
methods of warfarepillage fire extermination 
do not enrich them much the territories annexed 
do not suffice for their existence and they are thug 
condemned to prosecute from year to year their 
expeditions against the peoples who surrounded 
them such has been the existence of samory for 
about OF years it is probable that he will be the 
last of these SOUDANESE ATTILA for now that 
french conquest is organizing itself little by little 
and military posts cover the country in all parts 
the reappearance of similar scourges seems wholly 
impossible 
how do the sofas recruit their numbers by 
the chance results of their conquests a town 
being taken a country being conquered the sofa 
chiefs make a choice among the captives the 
young and vigorous men go to augment their forces 
the others are sold to slave merchants SAMORY 
bands then form a collection of all the negro 
races of the soudan there are sarakoules 
haras WOLOFS side by side with XIMENES and 
LIKES 

their costume almost invariably consists of a 
jacket and a pair of very short drawers their 
heads are not entirely shaved like those of the 
indigenous tribes but only in places in such a way as 
to keep on the skull one two or three tufts of hair 
which they allow to grow as long as possible these 
clowns locks some twisted rings of wrought iron 
on the arms and a few grigris fetishes ARE the 
only ornaments of their costume 
it is not only by their dress that at first sight 
they MIFFIER from the natives who go about clad in 
bonbons long and flowing robes after the style of 
the arab costumes nothing in the gait in the 
maimer of the sofas recalls the customary indolence 
of the blacks the eye is quick the air alert and 
they impress by their animation vigour and 
suppleness they should he seen galloping on 
horseback behind their chiefs hounding across the tall 
grasses up hill and down dale for hours together 
in a heat like that of a furnace truly their degree of 
animation is remarkable add to this portrait en 
LESS muzzleloaders or some CHASEPORTS and gras 
rifles adorn these types with large sabres on the 
one side with powder-flasks on the other with 
little bullet-bags and knives almost everywhere and 
you will have the perfect black condottiere 
the sofa privates are all infantry and there is 
no cavalry properly so called among their troops 
the chiefs who are rather numerous alone are 
mounted and their mounts consists of horses of 
the size of ponies degenerate descendants of the 
arab race there is nothing uniform in the 
costume of the chiefs unless it be the spurs which all 
wear fastened even to the naked feet for the 
rest they seem to have dressed in the cave of fra 
diavolo one has made himself a bonbon with a 
travelling rug striped TIGERLIKE with orange and 
black another decks himself ridiculously in a 
horseguards tunic which has lost its smartness a third 
struts about in the complete uniform of a senegal 
spahi some deserter perhaps i have seen one 
who had sewn a fishing-seton a long fawn-coloured 
jacket and so seemed to he in a coat of mail the 
bonbons of all colours are indeed the lot of THE less 
fortunate the really best form is to wear two or 
three superposed one upon the other and of 
different shades but it is in the choice if 
headdresses that their fancy has given itself the freest 
course turbans fezzes native caps rather similar 
to our NIGHTCAPS straw hats arched in the 
ANAMITE fashion or pointed like the cover of a 
beehive velvet SKULLCAPS caps of monkey-for all kinds 
are found as to the horses with their little bells 
and their grigris round the neck covered with 
many-coloured headwork almost everywhere they 
are in perfect harmony with this ludicrous medley 
of colours 

arrived on the territories of which the sofas had 
taken possession kemoko-biali their great chief 
sent to escort and to salute us a certain number of 
his lieutenants we were delighted to see them 
gallop among us on the flanks of our column for 
with them galloped as wellhut on FOOTBALL their 
establishment civil military and conjugal at 
once each chief had his own consisting of say 
six or seven hectoring fellows and one or two wives 
the latter carried on their heads the rice and other 
eatables and the cooking utensils the former 
besides their personal arms were entrustedone with 
the chiefs gun another with his sabre another 
with his hammock another with his sandals another 
with his little copper basin destined for the 
ablutions prescribed by the koran another with a 
small chair exceedingly low very curious by reason 
of its silhouette with romanesque LINES gift of 
honour from their supreme chief samory to the 
sofas this little piece of furniture represents 
something like the order of the bath or the legion of 
honour during the march all the men and 
women surround the chief without intermission like 
the setting of a gem trotting when he trots leaping 

OF 

lirtbu leaps and only resting when he deigns to 
descend from his saddle there are TRIOSE who like 
the fourth officer in the song about MARLBOROUGH 
carry nothing they like gadflies attach 
THEMSELVES closely to the horses crupper and according 
to the needs of the moment stimulate him to speed 
or moderate his pace BYGANGING on to his tail 
the envoys of kemokobilali had bidden us 
welcome by presenting us with a pannier of kola 
nuts which among the negroes of the upper NIGEL 
take the place of the bread and salt of western 
hospitality they had also bestowed upon us a STOCK 
honeyed words all coloured with the exquisite 
POLITENESS of the orientals you have left your own 
home said the principal person among them and 
you are now at home again you need concern 
yourselves with nothing further your mouths are 
my mouth your eyes are my eyes your feet 
ARE ANY feet your desires are my desires i will 
provide for your sustenance i will procure you all 
the porters you need if you need some one to 
carry your pipe you shall have him 
when we arrive at simangarea where 
BIALI had established his camp a sumptuous 
reception is prepared fo RUS we find three large cabins 
erected to shelter us with our people hardly have 
we dismounted from our horses then immense 
calabashes are brought to us containing hot cooked 
rice seasoned with not very inviting sauces and 
smelling of rancid FILTHY d plus ultra of negro 
culinary art 
they have cleared the space before our huts for 
a great distance and the attention touches us very 
much for it shelters us from an unforeseen attack 
or from a surprise which our dangerous hosts might 
meditate it is not however with that intention 
that they have cleared the space before us we 
very soon see why it has been done hardly have 
our tents been pitched and our installation 
completed than lo the plain is invaded by two or three 
thousand sofas who at the other extremity proceed to 
group themselves in a SEMICIRCLE before our cabins 
an attack no an entertainment 
kcmoko-Billi himself conducts the fete he 
comes to us curvetting on ids horse surrounded 
by tambourine players also on horseback clad in 
blue red and white with long scarves worn 
crosswise he is followed by his personal guard ten 
soldiers in a rank knowing marvellous to 
relate almost how to march in step and keep their 
rifles on their shoulders as they should do they 
are all armed with chassepots and gras rifles they 
must have been drilled by some deserter from our 
senegal troops 
it is kemoko-bird whom the english troops 
will have to fight in the course of the expedition 
he is the favourite lieutenant of samory who has 
given him the command of all the sofas in that part 
of his territory he is a negro still young with 
very regular features and a very alert air ids 
intelligent face impresses one at once a skilful 
negotiator almost a diplomatist he seemed to us in the 
course of numerous palavers which we subsequently 
had with him to be far above the average of the 
most gifted negroes finally his courage is 
proverbial among the sofas when for the first time 
he appeared to us at this entertainment he put 
himself to enormous pains to appear 
ing curvetting very proud to discharge before us 
the six shots of the revolver which he held in each 
hand changing his horse as many as three times

any the more for that the expense lavished on his 
toilet was great he strutted in a dazzling orange 
robe with ample folds and wide sleeves whence 
appeared as well by the slashing of the sides as by 
the lower part of the garment underclothing of pure 
white which still further heightened the 
gorgeousness of the robe this latter was rendered more 
taking by some long red curtain bands which were 
arranged crosswise on the chest the extremities I

encased in moorish boots of yellow leather and on 
his head was placed as the crowning decoration 
a SKULLCAP of black velvet with a gold tassel

transport on the ZAMBESI 
trade of british central africa 

the BRITISH consul at QUELIMANE in a 
recent report on the trade of that place 
mentions that nothing has yet been done towards 
organizing the steamer transport to 
RUMBLE transport to CHILOMA and KATANGA 
port BLANTYRE is done from CHILDE for the 
most part by steamers and lighters towed by 
steamers rough goods go mostly by lighters 
propelled by oars and sails the value of the 
imports and exports of british central africa 
amounted last year to 80000 says the times 
most of the imports and all the exports 
passing through CHILDE the ANTISLAVERY 
expedition under the command of major von 
WEISSMANN placed a steam launch and two 
large lighters on the ZAMBESI which were 
subsequently made use of by the admiralty 
expedition entrusted with the transport 
of the three NYASSA gunboats in the 
course of the coming year probably four 
more steamers with attendant lighters will 
be placed on the ZAMBESI some of these will 
belong to the african flotilla company and 
the rest to private firms the fuel used on 
river steamers is mostly wood coal is imported 
from time to time from natal both to CHILDE 
and quillimane but no coal from the 
BEST has yet come on the market the 
telegraph line has been completed to CHILDE 
gwengue and maquival and is being rapidly 
pushed on to tete the main lines to 
CHILOMA and gwengue are well looked after 
hut that to CHILDE is unreliable DOING THE 
wet season the lines are largely used and 
are much appreciated by merchantstall

from OCR special correspondent 

MENNO uganda june OF 
SELIM bey again reiterated that if MANGA attacked 
the MAHOMETANS he would consider that he was 
being attacked and further added that if any active 
measures were put in force against them he and his men 
would at once come up and join them this was mutiny 
point blank a kind of ominous silence prevailed as the 
SOUDANESE assembled to watch our departure SELIM 
bey by lotting us go lost THE best card he held in his 
hand 
after a somewhat trying march we arrived safely at 
kampala ALERT pm and there f learnt the details 
of all that had happened from captain MACDONALD 
himself immediately after the receipt of SELIM beys 
message he had despatched runners to overtake the 
SOONER then supposed to be in KAVIRONDO with letters 
detailing the serious state of affairs and asking him to 
return me had carried out his programme that 
afternoon and everything had passed off well the members 
of the cm s had strolled quietly over to the fort and 
when all was ready the SOUDANESE were called upon to 
show their loyalty which they at once did by marching 
over to the ZANZIBARI campus directed in addition he 
had also quietly arrested junta anti two others that 
morn IN having found them within the SOUDANESE 
quarters me had informed LUMP that in consequence of 
SELIM beys message they would be retained as hostages 
for the good behaviour of the MAHOMETANS and that he 

TH march 1894 
LUMP must send them word to say that if they wished 
to prove their pacific intentions as they said they must 
leave BATETE at once and return to their provinces 
JUMP replied that unless he went himself they would 
not listen thereupon captain MACDONALD intimated 
that he would accompany him and that upon the first 
sign of treachery he would have him shot upon 
hearing this JUMP was exceedingly anxious to remain behind 
but was taken down in spite of his unwillingness to go 
captain MACDONALD who ran considerable risk in thus 
exposing himself almost unguarded in their midst 
called up the principal chiefs on his arrival at natctc 
they declared they had no desire to enter upon hostilities 
and would give up the QUASI in addition to JUMP as a 
hostage but that as he was ill at the time he could not 
be brought up to kampala till the following morning 
in the meantime they produced two others who were 
taken back to the fort 
upon receiving the further intelligence of the 
mutinous language used to mr REDDICK in addition to the 
news that the MAHOMETANS had been reinforced by 
several hundred rifles from their provinces on the night of 
our arrival at kampala captain MACDONALD decided 
upon taking certain more active measures which the 
urgency of the situation demanded accordingly on the 
following morning june OF the english missionaries 
who came forward most readily and proffered their 
services at this crisis arrived at the fort and were 
armed in common with all the other europeans at 
pala all the available coast porters were likewise 
mustered and armed and the maxim gun made ready 
for action these preparations completed captain 
donald ordered the SOUDANESE to fall in outside the fort 
under cover of the rifles of the impromptu garrison he 
went out and after addressing the soldiers ordered them 
to lay down their arms the moment was critical but 
the order was obeyed and the men marched quietly off 
the ground in the meantime the kings war drums had 
beaten and the protestants had mustered in strong 
force a message was then sent to the MAHOMETANS 
who had not fulfilled their promise of sending the 
si up as a hostage to inform them that if they had not 
left NANETE CN route for their provinces by OF oclock 
they would be turned out by force in a short time the 
messenger returned and reported that they had refused 
to leave and were preparing to fight so the protestants 
were ordered to go and evict them from NATES 
a quarter of an hour afterwards the firing commenced 
and the first wounded began to arrive at kampala it 
was soon over the MAHOMETANS fled towards their 
provinces hotly pursued by the protestants who are said 
to have considerably damaged their disorganised ranks 
the QUASI being one of the first to fall though 
reported as being too ill to come to the fort he was not too ill 
to fight and thereby his life was justly forfeited the 
protestant loss was not at all serious some m or OF 
wounded came in for treatment by dr MOFFAT only two 
of the cases proving fatal some of the others though 
most severely wounded exhibited the marvellous 
recuperative powers possessed by the native constitution in 
cases of serious injury and rapidly recovered from the 
shock of their wounds before proceeding to 
extremities with the MAHOMETANS arrangements had been made 
with the protestants to leave a reserve of 500 guns 
behind to reinforce the garrison at the fort but carried 
away by the prevailing excitement they had all joined 
in the pursuit this was somewhat awkward as 
tain MACDONALD had intended to march on to port alice 
the following day in order to disarm the SOUDANESE 
there and arrest SELIM bey who was reported to have 
sent pickets out along the road to MENNO as it 
appeared quite possible that SELIM bey might offer resistance 
it was necessary to take down an adequate force and 
captain MACDONALD was therefore obliged to await the 
return of the protestants with a view to securing their 
safety he had requested the english missionaries to take 
up their residence inside the fort until all further danger 
was over and to this arrangement they had readily 
agreed the french priests stationed at rubaga hail 
fled with all their followers towards BUNDU on the first 
sign of approaching hostilities before leaving they 
WROTE a most amusing letter to captain MACDONALD 
excusing their flight on the ground that their creed 
FORBADE them to indulge in hostilities 
by noon on the WITH the bulk of the protestants had 
returned and captain MACDONALD now only awaited the 
return of lieutenant arthur who was expected that 
evening before advancing on to port alice however 
as the day wore on some WAGANDA scouts came in to 
report that SELIM bey had left port alice with his force 
and was marching across to join the MAHOMETANS the 
war DRUMS at once rang out and some 2000 protestants 
started to cut them off hen the further news arrived 
that he was within an hours march of the capital the 
excitement became intense it turned out however 
to be a false ARM as it was merely a deputation of OF 
SOUDANESE arriving FROM port alice with a message from 
SELIM bay that he would give in and obey all orders and 
that everything was right at port alice these 
messengers were immediately disarmed and brought in during 
the evening lieutenant arthur arrivedaccompanied by
