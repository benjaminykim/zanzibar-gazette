Bowel Complaint in Children. 

During the summer months children are subject 
to disorders of the bowels which should receive 
careful attenti'-n as soon as the first unnaturla, 
looseness of the bowels appears. The best me-

Colic, Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy as it 
promptly controls any unnatural looseness of the 
bowels, whether it be in a child or an adult. For

The current number of the Geographical 
Journal contains a paper on the Seychelles 
Archipelago by Mr. J. Stanley Gardiner, 
M.,y, which will well repay perusal. Though 
written in a pleasing descriptive style, the 
paper is crammed with facts, some of 
which we summarize : 
The archipelago consists of 29 islands : 
1,100 miles from Zanzibar. 
Mahe is the biggest and loftiest, covering 
an area of 58 square miles and rising to 
2,993 feet. 
There were no regular inhabitants before 
the advent of western peoples. 
The archipelago was completely annexed 
l 
>y the French in 175G and named after 
Moreau 
Sechellcs, Controlcur des Fi- 
nancis 

THE GAZETTE 

The first settlement was established 
about 1709 for the cultivation of nutmegs 
and cloves. 
The islands were captured in 179-1 by 
H. M. y. Orpheus (Captain JIewcome) and 
again in 1805 by H. M. S. Albion (Captain 
Feerieu); finally ceded and England 1814. 
Present population 21,000; birth rate 
34 f, death rate 17'71: 40 per cent of deaths 
are from old age. The regular tropical di- 
seases are unknown. 
Rainfall 100.8 inches (average last 15 
yearsi at sea level, 150 inches at an eleva- 
tion of 2.000 feet. Temperature of coast 
07-90 F., in the mountains 55-60 at night. 
Mr. Gardiner has something to say 
about the staple industry of Seychelles, 
and the story is a sad one, not without in- 
terest for us. “In any agricultural coun- 
try” he says, “a percentage of the profit 
should be set aside for the improvement of 
methods of cultivation, and of the stock 
(or plants)” and hn points out the folly of 
relying upon a single product, os the Sey- 
chelles have done. He looks forward, 
however, to a reaction against vanillin but 
on this point he is corrected, in the discus- 
sion. by Professor Duxstax, who explained 
that vanillin was not strictly speaking a 
chemical “substitute,” but the very sub- 
stance to which the plant chiefly owes its 
aromatic flavour ; that chemistry had suc- 
ceeded in producing from the oil of cloves a 
material (vanillin) which is identical with 
that found in vanilla, and that vanillin can 
be produced more cheaply from oil of cloves 
than from vanilla. Asa staple industry, 
therefore, vanilla is doomed though no 
doubt it will be able to hold its place in the 
colony as a subsidiary industry, 

Ihe rising hope of the islands is rubber 
which has been established by Mr Dupont, 
head of the Botanic station. “Its com- 
mercial success would seem assured,” but 
here again Professor Dukstax utters a 
word of warning. He points out that a 
rubber tree may flourish, as it does iu many 
parts of India, but nevertheless produce- 
very poor rubber. The Para trees in Sey- 
chelles are not yet old enough to test for 
their rubber-producing powers. The eco- 
nomic depression from which the islands 
suffer is due in part to the Code Napoleon, 
the law of the laud, under which on the 
death of the owner, the land is divided up 
among his children. It is anticipated, that 
m a few years the law of England will take 
the place of this to the advantage of indi- 
vidual ownership of property. High tribute 
we may conclude, is paid to the Governor, 
Mr. Davidson, “one of the most enlighten- 
ed of colonial administrators.” 

LEGAL. 

In H. B. M. Court for Zanzibar, Civil 
Side, Case No. 33 of 1907. Suleman Versi

Panachand Yirji (2) Naranji Bavji Defe-

against two defendants to recover 11 
259 
the value of a lost bale of Kangas. 
During the course of the action the 1st 
defendant Panachand Virji (tbe plaintiff’s 
clerk at the time the cause of the action 
arose) was, with the consent of all parties, 
withdrawn from the record. 
The facts as they appear from the evi- 
dence are clear. Plaintiff had in the tran- 
shipment godown at the Customs on the 
fGtli November 19'*b five bales of Kansas 
awaiting transhipment on to the Kaiser; 
The defendant Naranji was instructed to 
convey these in his lighter to the Kaiser.. 
The five bales were accordingly loaded on- 
to the lighter on'the Ifith November. The 
Kaiser did not come in that day', and it 
seems probable that Naranji informed plain- 
tiff that the baits would be out all night in 
the lighter. Any how it is certain that 
plaintiff knew on the 16th November that 
tbe bales were going to be out all night in 
the lighter. The Kaiser arrived on the 
19th and when the bales came to be shipped 
on the Kaiser, one bale was missing. That 
is the bale for the value of which plaintiff 
sues the lighter owner, the defendant Na- 
ranji. 
It would appear at first sight that Sec- 
tion 151 of the Indian Contract Act applies 
but in the case of the Irrawaddy Flotilla 
Co. rs. Bugwandas I. L. Pi. 18 Calcutta, 
620, the Judicial Committee of the Privy 
Council held that the Act was not inteuded 
to embrace the case of common carriers. 
The first question therefore to decide is, 
whether or not a Zanzibar lighterman is 
a common carrier. In the case of Liver 
Alkali Company us. Johnson, L. R. 9 Exch. 
338 it is laid down that a person who 
exercises the ordinary employment of a 
lighterman by carrying goods in iris flats 
for reward, although not bound as a com- 
mon carrier to receive tbe goods of all 
comers indifferently, nevertheless incurs 
the liability of a common carrier for the 
safety of goods carried by him. It is true 
that Cockburn L. C. J. in Scaife vs. Fnvaui 
L. B. 10 Exch. 358 thought that the Judg- 
ment quoted should be further considered, 
but the case has not been over-ruled and I 
am therefore bound by it, Ingate vs. 
Christee 3 Car and Kis 61 is another 
authority to the same effect. The exclu- 
sion from the list of common carriers of 
persons who do not ply below distinct 
points, such as an English cabman (Brind 
rs. Dale 8 Car & P. p. 207) seems to be con- 
fined to land carriage (see Macnamara on 
carriers Art. 21 (3) p. 19. Edition of 1888.) 
I bold therefore that under tho English 
law the defendant Naranji is prima- facie 
a common carrier. 
If this view is correct the Privy Council 
case above quoted applies and tbe Indian 
Contract Act does not affect this case. 
Thus by the Zanzibar Order in Council, 
I89i, the defendant’s liability is a- question 
of English law. 
There is a portion of the English law 
relating generally to carriers which deals 
exclusively with the liability of a carrier 
when he is acting ns warehouseman. Such 
law appears to me to fit this case, and it is 
to bo found in Chitty on Contracts (edition 
11) pp. 392-3. The cases there cited deal 

only with the responsibility of tho carrier 
after his actual carrying has finished. In 
the present case we have to deal with the 
responsibility before the actual carrying 
has begun. The principle however seems 
to be the same, and the cases are I think 
al' applicable. 
Mitchell vs. Lancashire and Yorkshire 
lily L. Ik 10. Queens Bench 2o(), establishes 
that though the carrier gives notice to the 
consignee that beholds the goods at owner’s 
risk he is nevertheless liable to keep the 
goods with reasonable care. (And see 
Crouch rs. G. AY. K. -3 H. and N. lf>3.) 
The question of that is reasonable care 
is a question of circumstances. A good 
deal of reliable evidence has been given 
upon the question of special custom. I 
find as a fact that it has been proved by 
this evidence to be the custom of lighter 
trade in Zanzibar that, where a lighter with 
goods is to bo out all night. 
to so inform the owners of the goods in his 
possession and 
son to place a guard upon those goods if he 
requires one. (The custom of the River 
Thames appears to be the exact oppo.dte. 
Addison 908-9) 
It has further been proved by the evi- 
dence that Xaranji so informed the plain- 
tiff on this occasion and according to the 
custom kept one man (some times two men) 
on the lighter to look after the lighter at 
night and to bale cut the water. Taking] 
these circumstances together I find that 
Naranji exercised reasonable care in this 
case, and is entitled to judgment. 
I ought perhaps to add that the defen- 
dants’ public Notice bas not in my opinion 
been proved to have been properly pub- 
lished. In any event, being a denial of all 
liability, as distinguished from a limitation 
of liability, it is bad. button rs. C-iciri J5 
A. C. JH and Lyon rs. Ale]Is o Ea-t 438 
Cliiity pp. 901-2). Tlie point however is 
not material to the case. 
I give Judgment for the defendant with 
the costs of both defendants against tho 
plaintiff. Counsel’s costs for Mr. AViggins 
Rs. jO for Mr. Eraniji Rs. 40.

A Reliable Remedy for Dysentery 

and Diarrhoea. 

As the season is at hand when diarrhoea and 
dysentery are prevalent, a reliable remedy 
should always be kept in the house for immedi- 
ate use. The success of Chamberlain’s Colic, 
Cholera and Diarrhoea Remedy in the treatment 
of bowel trouble, has brought it into almost 
universal use and the following letter indicates 
it is giving satisfaction in South Africa. Mr. 
J. H. Morris, Chemist at George, Cape Colony, 
says: -‘I have stocked Chamberlain’s Bemedies 
for some years and findt hem throughly salable, 
and in all cases answering the purpose for 
which they are intended.” For sale by all Che- 
mists. Sole Agent, SURGICAL HALL— Zan-

Mr. Winston Churchill speaking at the 
African Society’s dinner said that the de- 
velopment of the Crown Colonies and Pro- 
tectorates of Africa must figure prominently 
in the work of the Empire until they hud 
reached a self governin': status. Cotton 
fivas the thread which was most 
directly connecting the vast' communities 
at home with their vast estates in Africa 
and the Colonial Office was doing its best 
to encourage British Cotton growing and 
they looked especially to Uganda for deve- 
lopment of the Cotton Indnstiy. He was
