EAST AFRICAN NEWS. 

Wuddixo of Mb. Cave and Miss McLellan. 
0n f™iay the 19 th inst. was celebrated the wed- 
cung of Mr. \ ice-Consul Cave and Misa Marv C. 
McLellan. The civil ceremony was performed’ in 

the presence of a few friends, at 9 a. m. at. the 
British Agency, by Mr. Portal H. M.’s Diploma- 
tic Agent. The bridegroom with his best man, 
Mr. Cracknall, Judge of H. M.’s Consular Court, 
proceeded to the English Cathedral where almost 
the whole of the English comm unity had assembled 
to witness the ceremony. The road to the church 
was lined by several companies of His Highness’ 
troops commanded by General Hatch in person 
a salute being given on the arrival of the' bride 
conducted by Mr. Portal, who gave her away. 
Miss McLellan looked charming in her dress vrhich 
was u white silk made in Louis quiuze style, with 
large white felt hat and feathers. The marriage 
service was rendered more bt-antlful by a full Eng- 
lish choir, Mr. King being kind enough to act as 
orgamst. The ceremony was performed by the 
Revd. Dr. Hine who towards its close, delivered a 
short, impressive and appropriate address. At the 
conclusion the bride ani bridegroom led the pro- 
cession down the aisle, the Mission children scatter- 
ing flowers in front of the bride. Mr. Portal en- 
tertained a large company to a wedding breakfast 
at the Agency, and shortly afterwards Mr. and 
Mrs. Cave departed amidst showers of rice and 
universal expressions of good wishes to Mbweni 
where Miss Thackeray had placed her house at 
their disposal.

expected to reach Wanga until about the end of the 
present month. Lieut. Smith is now waiting at 
Wanga for Dr. Peters and is occupying himself 
meanwhile in making a survey of the head waters 
of the Umba river. 

Weather axd Crops. 

The weather during the past few weeks has been 
hot and dry, but from its present dull and cloudy 
appearance rain is now daily expected, in anticipa- 
tion of which sowing for next season’s crops has 
been generally carried out on the different planta- 
tions. Lightning has been very prevalent lately 
chiefly towards the south and west. A consider- 
able amount of rain is reported to have fallen on 
the mam-land (Mgau coast), and also in Mada- 
gascar. 

Exchange. 

The unfavourable rates now ruling are seriously 
affecting European business in Zanzibar as in India.

Pout Working. 

Despite tlio important and sudden change in the 
whole of the Customs arrangements, in making 
.Zanzibar a free port, the new system is working 
Tsry smoothly, and if only a permanent supply 
of aullicient labour can be arrauged there is no 
doubt that the present arrangements can be easily 
and satisfactorily worked. 

Rice. 

The market for rice is now very firm owing to 
short supplies and the close of the fruit season: a 
steamer with full cargo is expected from Calcutta 
and another from Bombay which will probably meet 
the demand.

The Times considers that the judgment given 
in the case reported yesterday is extremely im- 
portant and rests upon the earliest laws. An 
English Jury is obviously incompetent to decide 
the validity of Lobengula’s grants of land, only 
purely personal claims can now be tried by an 
English Jury. 
Mr. Vanlaun’s agreement is finally concluded, 
it gives to both companies representative seats on 
the Railway Board of Directors. The works are 
to be commenced next April. 
The Treasury will prosecute Messrs. Bottomley 
and Isaacs (the latter formerly Lord Mayor) for 
defrauding The Hansard Publishing Union to 
extent of £30,000.
