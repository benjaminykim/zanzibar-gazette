been very imperfect the book is published

cotton still occupies the front place in new 
african tropical products the central african 
times SAYST is a pleasing sight to see the 
bales of cotton being brought down to 
tyre on their way to london there is not 
the slightest doubt that cotton will be the 
great industry of the protectorate provided 
that it is fostered in its infancy by the 
government 

the german government is fully alive to 
the immediate possibilities of cotton 
cultivation in both west and east africa where 
the industry is being carefully and 
scientifically extended the african world says 
by the appointment of experts the creation 
of a cotton bureau and the increasing of 
transport facilities the german 
ment is displaying a thoroughness which 
might well be emulated by britain 

on the subject of cotton growing sir HH 

JOHNSTON in a letter to the times says 
the little protectorate of british central 
africa is rapidly coming to the front not only 
as a cotton-growing country but as a part of 
africa which can grow cotton of the very fines 

march A 1904 

quality the cotton which has been grown 
there intermittently by the natives for centuries 
pastgossypium herbaccum was no doubt 
originally an introduction by the arabs or kindred 
races of semitic stock who have traded with 
east africa for something like 3000 years 
there is a wild cotton plant in this and other 
parts of africa gossypium aifnmahnii but 
THIS a variety of gossypium 
DUCKED possibly by the portuguesewhich is 
now the widely cultivated form while the best 
cotton which british central africa can place 
on the market is derived from recently 
imported cultivated varieties of the same species from 
egypt in fact in many ways the climate and 
soil of british central africa seem more than 
I any OTHER part of the continent to vie with 
EGYPTIAN the production of cotton of first-rate 
QUALITY 

it will come as news to many that 
LIVINGSTONE was deputed by the 
ment of his day to open up the NYASA 
country for cotton growing 
this action was taken at a time when the 
impending struggle between the slave states 
and the northern states together with other 
troubles were threatening cotton famines in 
the supply from america in consequence of 
the shortage of supplies that commenced when 
the american civil war broke out a great 
impetus was given to cotton growing in egypt 
ARDIN india but LIVINGSTONE efforts with 
regard to british central africa had to wait 
something like OF years before they were 
renewed with energy

the RED chancellor WESTON delivered 
the second of his lenten course of lectures 
at christ church cathedral on sunday 
morning last 

the subject was the being of god from 
the point of view of revelation and its 
substance as follows 

hie doctrine of the holy trinity is not only 
a philosophy it is also a revelation given to 
the world by jesus christ 
when he began io teach he found the jews 
holding firmly the mosaic teaching of 
divine unit but feeling their way to an 
explanation of a unit that could think and love of 
the wisdom literature 
he taught his disciples touse names of 
father son and spirit while yet insisting 
that god was one thus they came to love 
father son and spirit leaving the doctrine 
itself undefined it came to he defined as men 
began to ask questions 

here the lecturer explained the dogma 
to this dogma we must apply three tests 
i I is there cause to accept it 
A is there reason for accepting it A 
A can we verify it in experience 
cause springs from authority all men 
recognize AUTHORITY REPAST of 
specialists in knowledge of accepted principles 
of science equity etc what cause is there 
here v 
a the teacher himself is admitted by all 
to he perfect man 
the society of his disciples damns to 
have acted on his doctrine and found it 
adequate 
c the book of his society is accepted as 
meeting human needs apart from its being 
the book of the church and it teaches the 
doctrine 

without a bias 

we have then cause good cause to consider 
the doctrine as worthy of acceptance if it will 
stand the other tests can reason accept it 
ii reason cannot command us to accept or 
to reject for she has her 
a she is only infallible when she deals with 
facts that do not change and when some 
of the facts ARE hidden she is more than ever 
cautious 
b reason is a personal faculty and is not 
remembering her limitations we may ask 
what can reason say to the teaching of christ 
c she must offer an opinion on the 
chart AFTER of the teacher and reason tells AS 
j that on OTHER matters we may more safely 
follow christ than any other of the worlds 
prophets 
b she must tell us rf the teaeliing in 
QUEST TON will agree with our knowledge of the 
world and human nature 
j last sunday we saw that it alone explains 

all the facts at present before us 

A 

to be worthy 

thus while reason is nimble to offer an 
opinion on the truth of the DUCT IN she tells that 
it is rational so far as she CAU see 
but she warns us that it is SUPERNATURAL 
SUPERRATIONAL 
the road along which the new teaching will 
lead us is visible to reasons eye but she o to nor 
climb the mountain of super natural truth her 
home is on the plains 
thus with the full approval of BOSON we 
seek a guide WII CAU lead us up the mountain 
and the guide is called faith 
hi the means by which we verify the 
teaching is faith 
faith is the submission of the whole man to a 
being outside himself 
I submission of the heart to one who is FELT 
A submission of the will to a will that wo 
perceive to be above our own and the best 
to be found 
A submission of the mind to a teaching that 
we accept on the word of HIM whom we 
have chosen 
this act of submission is the BEGINNING of WHO 
verification of the teaching we have taken for 
granted a certain theory it remains to sec if it 
will meet our needs 
faith assumes that god is acts as if god were 
present and finds that he is and does all that 
was asserted of him by the theory 
reason then steps in and by 
explainingcreated things shews us how god works and 
what his laws are in nature thus reason is 
the teacher of faith again reason helps to 
explain to faith man and his nature 011 the 
physical side 

but reason has a higher work to do 
WESAND that reason is infallible when 
dealing with fixed facts if all the facts ARE known 
therefore it cannot claim infallibility in the 
sphere of faith but it is put face tp face with a 
new series of facts discovered or revealed to 
faith and these new facts are at the disposal of 
reason here it has a wide field and does its 
true work 
reason then guides faith tp the boundary of ct 
land into which it may not itself enter faith 
crosses the boundary makes its capture and 
reason shares the spoil 
the man who walks by reason only will not 
get far he cannot by any means make bis 
way along the path to the spiritual world 

he must have the help of faith 
the man who walks by faith only will reach 
he promised land but he will miss the beauties 
of the country he is as one blind he is in his 
fathers land but the wonders of his father 
creative power are lost to him 
but he who walks by faith and reason is the 
heir of all things to him nothing is denied not 
even the blessed knowledge of god HIMSELF 
therefore no man can convinceanother of TBO 
truth of his theory except by example he may 
prove it true by shewing that it is adequate to 
meet the needs of man
