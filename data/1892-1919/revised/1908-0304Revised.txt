ir their beauty in the coolness of the an 
in the richness of the soil in their verdure 
in the abundance of running water and in 
their fertility absolutely surpassed

prance or italy it is just in the heart 
of this attractive country that the ZANZIBAR 
government has established its best

the many friends of admiral sir harry

came to zanzibar in 1832 that is OF years 
hack in the service of said bin sultan he 
was then a gunner on board the shahalam 
before being promoted to gunner he had 
been a quartermaster so was probably from 
OF to OF years old as he must have been

vs 

john MURPHY 

judgment 

this is an appeal from the finding and 
sentence of judge BASTARD who convicts 
one john murphy on february OF for 
cheating under section 420 and sentenced him 
to a months simple imprisonment ana n 
the facts are fully set out on the learned 
magistrates judgment and it is not 
necessary to repeat them here i have 
ered all the evidence very carefully 
though the offence is one which from ms 
nature must be treated cautiously i think 
there was sufficient evidence before the 
magistrate to qualify him m convicting 
the appellant i accordingly uphold the 
conviction 
i also agree with the sentence passed by 
judge busznrd a months imprisonment 
ANDRI fine is not in my opinion at all a 
severe sentence for an offence ot this 
description which resulted in the confidence 
being deprived of a diamond ring worth 
at the same time mr BEECH has called 
attention to the dangerous state of THE 
prisoners health who is obviously suffering 
from consumption on bis arrest by ECCO 
dram he was kept in aden prison for some 
weeks pending his transfer to zanzibar for 
trial and the prison medical authority there 
has put on record the fact that the prisoner 
was in a bad state of health and 
recommended an early change of air 
under these circumstances i hesitate oo 
send him to confinement in a tropical prison 
where his heal th may break down altogether 
and where he of necessity cannot receive 
the same attention as he would in ENGLAND 
where there is a resident medical officer 
and nurses 
aafliilst therefore in confirming THE 
sentence passed upon him i have decided y 
view of the fact that it is absolutely NECESSARY 
for the present state of his health that hr 
should not be confined in zanzibar to FREE 
that his term of imprisonment date from 
the time when he was arrested in aden 
i e from december OF provided his friends 
send him away from zanzibar at once 
as more than one month has elapsed 
from that date the prisoner will ho released 
on payment of the fine of BAMBOO and a 
guarantee that he will immediately leave 
this country
