the student of the growth and 
development of languages might do worse than pay 
a visit to british central africa where 
according to the testimony OF WATER 
the small NEWSSHEET published at zomba 
an interesting addition is being made 
to the language of tat part of AFRICA 
it MIGHT have been thought that africa had 
enough forms of speech of its own for not 
infrequently tribes separated by a few miles 
of country do not understand each other s 
language but it is perhaps for this very 
reason that the sikh soldiers who are now 
a permanent feature of british central 
africa life have invented a new language 
which appears to have become the military 
language of the protectorate the basis of 
the new language is said to be hindustani 
hut that it is a somewhat jumbled mixture 
MAY be gathered from this further list of 
gumrakhi broken swahiu 
broken MANGANJA possibly a little YAO and 
SEROV english nearly all the 
NONCOMMISSIONED officers in the protectorate forces 
are sikhs and it was of course necessary 
that they should communicate with THE 
natives who apart from the couple of 
hundred sikhs form the bulk of the little army 
which the commissioner has at his disposal 
it was this necessity no doubt that produced 
the new LANGUAGE but its use appears to be 
gradually extending outside military circles 
among the military it has been adopted by 
others than the sikhs in their intercourse 
with the natives a YAO NONCOMMISSIONED 
officer drilling his MAKUA recruits does so in 
this quaint compound and it is even 
suggested that the european learned in 
ja as it taught in ORTHODOX treatises is 
sometimes glad to avail himself of the 
services of a sikh soldier in making his 
meaning clear to a native the sikhs do not 
STAV long in africa the term of service 
forwhich they volunteer is i believe two 
YEARS but the new draft who come from 
india to take the place of their brethren 
who are returning home appear to have no 
difficulty in picking up a working QUAINTANCE 
with the language and in course of time it 
is quite possible that this mongrel compound 
may take the place of some of the many 
dialects which are the despair of travellers 
AND officials in africa

the crisis in the 

upper nile 

the most critical situation in africa at 
the present time is in the basin of the upper 
nile where events are takingplace 
compared with which delimitation quarrels in 
west africa and the retrocession of KASSALA 
sink into insignificance the recent 
advance up the nile from egypt can have but one 
ultimate AIME commercial reopening of 
the soudan which would inevitably RESULT 
from the occupation of khartoum the 
feelings of complaisant satisfaction with 
which england has watched the advance of 
i the egyptian army towards the gate of the 
soudan have not been disturbed by a 
consciousness of the fact that another power 
has quietly occupied the goal immediately 
after the british retreat from khartoum in 
1885 the french began preparations for 
the annexation of the 
province and the left bank of the upper nile in 
1687 they compelled the congo free state 
to agree to a fresh convention that of OF 
april 1887 whereby the french secured 
an easy route into the nile basin from the 
french congo as soon us the power of 
MAHDISM began to wane french agents 
crossed the low watershed that separated 
their province of the BOMU from the 

and they concluded treaties 
with the native chiefs these proceedings 
were conducted secretly and were not 
revealed until the escape of SATIN pasha who 
during his imprisonment at omdurman 
had translated the treaties and BRANCH 
proclamations meanwhile the belgians had 
attempted to annex the coveted 
GHAZI for the congo free state NELIS for 
example had actually occupied and fortified 
the town of KATUKA but on the belgian 
advance being made known in europe 
france pointed out that it was contrary to 
the convention of OF APRIL 1887 and 
insisted on the return of all the congo free 
state forces to the south of the BOMU 
finding from the belgian success that 
DIM was no longer powerful in central

junction with m LEOTARD but in all 
probability it has already taken place 
PHYSICALLY the country is well known so 
that exploration plays no part in the work 
of any of these expeditions which have 
been undertaken solely for the sake of 
political annexation the leaders claim to 
have taken possession of the country in the 
name of either france or abyssinia and it 
is necessary to consider the value of this 
occupation 
on the west bank of the nile the 
question depends on the relative value of the 
egyptian claim based on former possession 
and that of the french maintained on the 
ground of present occupation the british 
government has repeatedly affirmed that 
the is still egyptian and 
therefore in the british sphere of influence 
the french reply that there are no rights 
of sovereignty in africa unless supported 
by occupation and that the british retreat 
in 1885 and the declarations of 1889 leave 
thorn free to enter the country and hold it 
if they can 
on the east bank of the nile the question 
largely hinges on the treaty signed last 
may by MENELIK and mi BENDELL rodd 
the terms of that agreement are still secret 
the only rumours not based on manifest 
guessing are some that have reached paris 
from the abyssinian capital and the fact 
that they reach us THROUGH french sources 
renders them untrustworthy but the secret 
is more likely to be betrayed in 
AMEBA than in london according to these 
rumours england agreed to recognise the 
abyssinian possession of the whole of the 
territory on the right bank of the nile from 
just south of khartoum to the albert 
nyanza and north of a line drawn thence 
eastward along the second parallel of north 
latitude to the juba the whole of this 
vast area is at any rate claimed by the 
abyssinians and the negus has entrusted 
the administration of the southern part to 
the franco-russian association of count 
lcontieff if this preposterous abyssinian 
claim be admitted then british east africa 
is cut off from the north by a belt of 
country either french or under french 
administration extending right across africa 
from the red sea to the atlantic the 
possession of uganda and khartoum will 
bo useless and the millions of money 
devoted to the nile campaign and the uganda 
railway will have been spent in vain and 
this british failure will be all the more 
mortifying from the painful contrast 
between the secrecy and swiftness of the 
french movements and the blundering 
clumsiness with which the english 
competitor in the race for FASHODA has entered 
the field in this case alas the race is to

the cultivation of 
olives i tun 
ifc is certain that the greater part of the 
mediterranean littoral was in ancient tunes as 
it now the hom of the olive ANDO all t se 

countries which claim TFC tree AS indigenous 
italy is that which is the chief cf the 
oil-producing countries of the region and in italy it 
grows upon a great variety of soil and in a fair 
variety of climate it is found wild on the 
scorching and rocky hills near TARANTO where 
it grows from seeds which have probably been 
carried from place to place by birds and casually 
deposited in some fissure where sufficient soil 
has been found to nourish the young plant 
for birds are extremely partial to olives indeed 
in the southern provinces of italy the 
large migratory thrush so heartily praised by 
HORACE his journey to brundusiumstill 
abounds we find the expense of gunpowder for 
bird-scaring a considerable item in the 
olivegrowers accounts the cultivated olive too is 
a tree which is very independent of soil and may 
be seen growing on a rocky hillside or on the 
deep soil of the plains and flourishing as well in 
the one situation as in the other 
the small province of LUCCA has given its 
name to the finest table oil in the world and 
though the best oils of bari in tills district 
compare favourably with it they have not the same 
celebrity 
of the south italian oils those ol bari have 
the greatest repute and many of the trees 
are of great antiquity the annual export 
of oil from italy amounted in 1888 to 
63500 tons a very large proportion of this 
exports goes to the british empire and though 
no doubt the importers care little about the 
methods of the cultivation of the tree as compared 
with the market price at which they can purchase 
the oil wholesale the cultivation is an important 
item to british trade because a determined effort 
is boing made to introduce the tree both in south 
africa and the australian colonies the plants 
are being sent out in considerable numbers from 
naples chiefly if not solely by the firm of 
messrs AMMANN of PORTICO a suburb of naples 
who have also charged themselves with the 
introduction of the KAROS into SOUTH africa 
it is unnecessary to mention the variety of 
uses to which olive oil is put but it may be 
interesting to note that large quantities are used on 
sheep-runs in the colonies for sharpening the 
clippers at shearing time time alone can show 
what success the introduction of the tree will 
have in our colonies it may be that the best 
oil will be produced it may also be that only 
the lower class oils such as those grown in 
turkey which are only useful for making soap 
will be manufactured but at any rate a useful 
lubricant will be obtained and a very picturesque 
tree added to the landscape in the meantime a 
report in english on the cultivation of the plant 
cannot fail to be of service the wild olive or 
oleaster is a tree of small and stunted growth 
and yields a fruit from which very little oil can 
be procured the grafting of the oleaster was 
known in very ancient times and is mentioned 
by st paul in his epistle to the romans who 
however for the reasons of his metaphor or 
perhaps from ignorance of arboriculture reverses 
the process and describes the oleaster as being 
grafted on the olive whereas of course it is the 
cultivated tree which is grafted on the stem of 
the wild one the oleaster can be raised from 
seeds in the ordinary way or it can be raised 
from the fungoids which olives hear underground 
at the point where the roots separate themselves 
from the trunk olive trees live to a very great 
age and their wood is very useful for 
cabinetmaking as it is hard as well as PLIABLE and can 
be easily manipulated the smaller boughs 
form an excellent fuel for owing to the oil in 
them they burn like a torch and as the trunks 
of old trees are apt to become hollow many of 
them are only fit for the purpose the 
is evergreen and the leaves fall after about 

throe years being of course constantly replaced 
in the course of nature by younger ones the 
olive commences to flower at the base of its 
foliage the flowers gradually extending upwards 
the best crops are always obtained when the 
trees flower early and this occurs when the 
spring is mild as early as the month of march 
but the tree is susceptible to cold and if it gets 
checked it will flower as late as june in which 
case a failure of the crop may be anticipated 
old trees usually yield a crop only every 
alternate year which is gathered in the autumn and 
early winter the largest trees are found in 
sicily where they grow almost like oaks and 
may be found measuring OF ft round the trunk 
the italian BLUEBOOK on agriculture 
published in 1874 names 300 varieties of the tree 
as existing in italy of which OF are found in 
the district of naples obviously in a country 
like italy where so many dialects are spoken in 
many cases THE names of these varieties are 
purely local and as the same variety is called by one 
name in tuscany and by another at naples it 
would be absolutely useless to mention 
distinctions which have no difference in a report written 
for british readers 
olives are in fact divided into three classes 
namely i the small olive with few leaves which 
grows freely resists the cold better than the others 
is more free from disease grows on the poorest 
soil and though generally very hardy does not 
yield good oil and is useless for table purposes 
this tree will yield oil good enough for sharpening 
shears and for mechanical purposes generally 
and it will grow almost anywhere it is known 
by the names of miguda TRIOL cericiola and 
MARTINO in italy the second class known as 
OLIVE di spagnahas larger leaves a large and 
succulent fruit adapted for table use subject to 
the necessary treatment these trees require rich 
and good soil and no great vicissitudes of tern 
FEATURE they will not bear cold and are subject 
to a good many diseases it they get chilled the 
fruit falls and such berries as remain give but 
little oil and that of poor quality these 
varieties are supposed to have come to italy from 
spain and to have found a climate in italy which 
does not always agree with them they might 
all the same do well in the warmer climate of 
australia the third class is PREFERABLE for 
general cultivation as it avoids both extremes being 
hardy and at the same time producing a good 
and useful crop these are known in italy by 
the names of RAZZER CARNIOLA ogliarolo 
PICUDO OND MONOPOLES 
like the palm the olive flourish in many 
places where it will bear no fruit it will not 
yield in very hot places and it will not endure 
frost or sudden transitions from cold to LIEST it 
does not mind sea air and in many places on 
the mediterranean it grows to the waters edge 
where it must often be affected by salt and spray 
TWELVE degrees centigrade below zero LEGS 
fahr is enough to wither the leaves and to kill 
such roots as are on the surface a late spring 
frost is naturally more harmful than a winter one 
where the wild olive tree grows it is a simple 
matter to transplant and graft it but this will 
not occur in the colonies for many years to come 
the olive also grows from seed and this in fact 
though it is a slow process is in the end superior 
to any other the trees do better live longer 
and are much less liable to disease than those 
propagated in any other way the seed will 
germinate in the second year if left to itself hut if 
it is softened by being placed in a pap of clay and 
cow-dung and sown thus it will germinate the 
same year it is necessary to sow in thoroughly 
clean ground so as to allow a free and prompt 
expansion of the rootlets the ground should be 
dug three feet deep thoroughly cleaned and 
richly manured this should he done in the

winter and in the spring the surface should be 
laid out in shallow trenches in which the seeds 
should be sown in rows about a foot apart with a 
distance between the seeds of not less than six 
inches the sharp end of the seeds should be 
upwards and they should be treated with a fair 
amount of water it is especially essential that 
the ground should be kept clean and all weeds 
immediately removed in the spring of the third 
year the seedlings may be moved to the nursery 
all shoots appearing on the tiny trunks having 
been carefully removed 
the most usual way of propagating the olive 
is by means of an egg-shaped fungus growth 
which is found upon its roots it is about the 
size and much the shape of any turkeys egg and 
grows OUTSIDE the bark not more than two of 
such fungi should be removed from a single tree 
or damage will be done to it indeed if 
propagation is attempted on a large scale it is better 
to sacrifice one tree altogether than to run the 
risk of injuring a greater number thus a 
hundred or more of these fungi can be obtained from 
a single tree in the winter besides n great number 
of slips and grafts in the spring when the tree 
can be felled and disposed of the removal of 
the fungus must be done with care the wood of 
the root round it must be carefully saw or chipped 
with a sharp axe a chisel must then be used to 
undercut the fungus and finally lift it out of its 
place the wood which adheres to it can then be 
cut off with a sharp knife if the fungus has 
plenty of eyes it may cut up like a seed potato 
but it is always advisable to make the pieces so 
large that each piece should have three or four 
eyes if the fungus has made any roots these 
should be carefully removed the best time to 
take them is in the winter before the sap begins 
to rise and they can be kept till the spring in dry 
earth mixed with chaff to soften it they should 
be planted in march 
the proverbial wisdom of TAMILS 
the latest addition to RUNNERS oriental 
IS is a classified collection of tamil proverbs 
with translations explanations and index 
ARRANGED by herman jansen all such collections 
of proverbs are of great use to anyone who 
wishes to obtain information about the inner life of 
the uneducated natives of the country and about 
their sentiments on all manner of subjects 
moral religious political and social it is 
extremely difficult to get such information by means of 
cross-examination as indians conversing with 
europeans are generally shy reticent and 
inclined to say what they think will please their 
questioner but when we read their proverbs we 
are to a large extent admitted behind the scenes j wonderful identity 
and seem to hear what they say in familiar con instance the large 
versatiori one with another for a large portion 
of their conversation is actually made up of 
proverbs which they employ as liberally as the 
immortal sancho ANTHE expression of their hopes 
and their fears their praise and their blame and 
their ideas of right and wrong TIME it is that 
s mr jansen well remarks by a good 
knowledge of indian proverbs one is enabled as it 
were to feel the moral pulse of the indian people 
and a sound insight into the proverbial literature 
f india is like getting a microscope by which 
one can look deeply into the recesses of the 
native heart this result is much facilitated by 
mr dnnsens careful classification of his 
collection of tamil proverbs according to their subject 
matter the classification of the proverbs also 
enables us more easily to discern the 
resemblances and differences between indian and 
lish proverbs thus mr jansen points out 
that while in england we have a large number 
of proverbs referring to the weather and the 
seasons india has very few proverbs of the kind as 
in this country the weather is monotonous and I seen the face of the 

there are practically only two seasons the com 
parison implied in the saying that a womans 
mind and winter wind change oft would be 
UNINTELLIGIBLE to indian peasants for in their 
experience the direction of the wind is generally 
fixed by the tune of day and season of the year 
the difference between the position of woman 
in the east and west is very clearly reflected in 
proverbs hi seclusion of women at d their 
restriction to household AFFAIRS is expressed by 
the tamil proverb what has a frog in a well to 
do with the affairs of the country applied to a 
woman who wants to know what is in the 
newspapers popular suspicion of female education 
is strongly put in the saying that it is better to 
marry a women of bad character than one who 
has learned to read the indian proverbs about 
women are affected by the fact that in india we 
have no girls and young ladies we meet in 
india with female children and wives as the 
indian woman passes ATONE from being a child 
to being a wife but in europe young women 
have a fine time for their development both 
physical and intellectual before they get married 
in this transition period then there is a rich 
sphere for english proverbs but as there is no 
such period in india there ARE no such indian 
proverbs india has accordingly no proverbs 
about flirting and court and as widows may 
seldom and never be remarried there are of course 
no indian proverbs about the dangerous wiles of 
widows on the LOOKOUT for husbands the 
despised and oppressed indian widow has little in 
common with the jolly buxom widow who plays 
such a lively part in western proverbs ANTI 
comedies 

you have seen the mother at the tank-side there 
is no need to see the child at home is a 
recognition of the law of heredity or of the influence of 
a mothers teaching OTHER children all these 
proverbs are as true of english i s of tamil 
mothers in india as in england the beggar will 
do rather than work so we are not SIX 
prised to hear that if you tell a mendicant to 
go and dig potatoes he gets angry but if the 
potatoes are boiled and peeled and set before 
bun BEWALL devour them the DIFFICULTY of 
getting money from a skinflint is COMPARED in 
england to getting blood out of a stone in 
southern india to stripping bark of a stone 
when its bowels are dry with hunger a horse 
will eat straw is the tamil way of saying that 
hunger is the host sauce that man must eat 
to live is characteristically expressed in tamil by 
describing the body as a wall made of rice the 
fact that delays are dangerous is illustrated by 
reference to a man who looked out for an 
auspicious day to dig a well to quench a burning 
house the tamil equivalents of TTS no use 
crying over spilt milk are will the flood that 
that HAS leaped over its banks go back if you 
weep and the water the hot iron has drunk 
will not come back again he who forgets that 
charity begins at home is be a man who 
feeds brahminswhile his own mother starves 
as husbands in india often punish their wives 
by cutting of their noses the irrevocable effects 
of yielding to violent fits of anger is illustrated 
by the impossibility of restoring a nose that HAS 
once been cut off a stupid person in england 
does not know chalk from cheese or a duck from 
a daisy in india he sees no difference between 
a banyan tree and a tamarind between ginger 
and lime or he does not know how many 
va princes there were and says they were 
many as the legs of a bedthree 
the last quoted proverb illustrates the IMMENSE 
POPULARLY of the MAHABHARATA among a l sorts 
and conditions of hindus the same may be 
said of the RAMAYANA both these epic poems 
are as familiar to the people of india as the 
bible is to the people of england those who 
cannot read them in sanskrit know them by 
MEANS vernacular translations and this knowledge 
is presupposed in a large number of proverbs 
he is a palli plant to the garden and SAGUIN 
COTHE family could not have come into common 
use AS a proverb if every indian schoolboy had 
not known that SANGUINE is the name of the 
councillor WAS ruined the ehaurava family the 
uselessness of making complaints to an 
unsympathetic hearer is expressed in the question if you 
recite the mahabharata to a richly bejewelled 
woman will she look at her ornaments or will she 
listen to the poem from the RAMAYANA are 
drawn the three following proverbs of a stupid 
person it is said that after having heard the 
the RAMAYANA read all night be asked bow 
rama was ralntedto sita a hypocrite is said 
be ascetic like RAVANA when a good master 
has a good servant it will be remarked that OF 
the king is like rama his servant will be like 
hanuman the monkey god who distinguished 
himself by his faithful service to rama the 
ordinary monkey is not overlooked in proverbial 
philosophy a man warned that he may bo 
deceived replies will a monkey miss brunch it

wonderful agility displayed by monkeys jumping

ways of ANIMALS the makers of TAMI p VERBS 
saw through the cat and detected her as a demure 
humbug of anyone who looks as if utter 
rain will not thrive when would not melt in bis mouth they say will tins 

on the whole however when we compare the 
proverbs of different nations we are much more 
struck by the resemblances than by the 
differences almost every proverb is a touch of nature 
making the whole world kin proverbs are the 
expression of the public opinion of the majority 
of any nation and it is wonderful how great a 
consensus there is upon all essential questions of 
morality and prudence all the world over 
verbs express the broad characteristics of human 
life and human relationship which are very much 
the same in every age and country the 
difference between the proverbs of different 
nations is not so much in the thought expressed as 
in the mode of expressing it of course the 
proverbs of india are distinguished by special local 
colouring i heir illustrations are necessarily 
taken from the banyan tree the betel nut the 
monkey and the flying fox and from the 
manners and customs of the indian people but 
under this diversity of language is hidden 
of thought take for 
number of tamil 
proverbs that refer to the character of a mother 
and her position in the house most of them are 
as true of english french or german mothers 
as of those who speak the language in which 
the proverbs are expressed they express 
truths of world wide application they tell us 
that the relationship of mother and son 
is the closest of all RELAXATIONS that the who 
does not help his mother is the most worthless 
of men that a mother will not abandon her child 
though it turns out a very devil maternal 
selfsacrifice is expressed by saying she reared her 
child with meat while she ate bones a child 
ought to know that no temple is more beautiful 
than ones mother but children are often 
ungrateful and make little return of affection for all 
their mothers kindness so it is said that the 
mothers heart is tender the childs hard 
that curds and rice will make a child forget its 
mother the sad lot of motherless children is 
illustrated by saying that a child that has not

PHYSICALLY the country is well known so 
that exploration PLAYING part in the work 
of any of these expeditions which have 
been undertaken solely for the sake of 
political annexation the leaders claim to 
have taken possession of the country in the 
name of either france or abyssinia and it 
is necessary to consider the value of this 
occupation 
on the west bank of the nile the 
question depends on the relative value of the 
egyptian claim based on former possession 
and that of the french maintained on the 
ground of present occupation the british 
government has repeatedly affirmed that 
the is still egyptian and 
therefore in the british sphere of influence 
the french reply that there ARE no rights 
of sovereignty m africa unless supported

the terms of that agreement are still secret 
the only rumours not based on manifest

from the abyssinian capital and the fact 
that they reach us THROUGH french sources

is more likely to be betrayed in 
abebathan in london according to these 
rumours england agreed to recognise the 
abyssinian possession of the whole of the 
territory on the right bank of the nile from 
just south of khartoum to the albert

eastward along the second parallel of north

abyssinians and the negus has entrusted

claim be admitted then british east africa 
is cut off from tho north by a belt of

from the red sea to the atlantic the 
possession of uganda and khartoum will

devoted to the nile campaign and the uganda

this british failure will be all the more

countries which claim THE tree as indigenous 
italy is that which is the chief cf the 
oil-producing countries of the region and in italy it 
grows upon a great variety of soil and in a fair 
variety of climate it is found wild on the 
scorching and rocky hills near TARANTO where 
it grows from seeds which have probably been 
carried from place to place by birds and casually 
deposited in some fissure where sufficient soil 
has been found to nourish the young plant 
for birds are extremely partial to olives indeed 
in the southern provinces of italy where the 
large migratory thrush so heartily praised by 
HORACE his journey to brundusiumstill 
abounds we find the expense of gunpowder for 
bird-scaring a considerable item in the 
olivegrowers accounts the cultivated olive too is 
a tree which is very independent of soil and may 
be seen growing on a rocky hillside or on the 
deep soil of the plains and flourishing as well in 
the one situation as in the other 
the small province of LUCCA has given its 
name to the finest table oil in the world and 
though the best oils of bari in TIKIS district 
compare favourably with it they have not the same 
celebrity 
of the MONTH italian oils those ol bari have 
the greatest repute and many of the trees 
are of great antiquity the annual export 
of oil from italy amounted in 1888 to 
63500 tons a very large proportion of this 
exports goes to the british empire and though 
no doubt the importers care little about the 
methods of the cultivation of the tree AS compared 
with the market price at which they can purchase 
the oil wholesale the cultivation is an important 
item to british trade because a determined effort 
is boing made to introduce the tree both in south 
africa and the australian colonies the plants 
are being sent out in considerable numbers from 
naples chiefly if not solely by the firm of 
messrs AMMANN of PORTICO a suburb of naples 
who have also charged themselves with the 
introduction of the KAROS into south africa 
it is unnecessary to mention the variety of 
uses to which olive oil put but it may be 
interesting to note that large quantities are used on 
sheep-runs in the colonies for sharpening the 
clippers at shearing time time alone can show 
what success the introduction of the tree will 
have in our colonies it may be that the best 
oil will be produced it may also be that only 
the lower class oils such as those grown in 
turkey which are only useful for making soap 
will be manufactured but at any rate a useful 
lubricant will be obtained and a very picturesque 
tree added to the landscape in the meantime a 
report in english on the cultivation of the plant 
cannot fail to be of service the wild olive or 
oleaster is a tree of small and stunted growth 
and yields a fruit from which very little oil can 
be procured the grafting of the oleaster was 
known in very ancient times and is mentioned 
by st paul in his epistle to the romans who 
however for the reasons of his metaphor or 
perhaps from ignorance of arboriculture reverses 
the process and describes the oleaster as being 
grafted on the olive whereas of course it is the 
cultivated tree which is grafted on the stem of 
the wild one the oleaster can be raised from 
seeds in the ordinary way or it can be raised 
from the fungoids which olives bear underground 
at the point where the roots separate themselves 
from the trunk olive trees live to a very great 
age and their wood is very useful for 
cabinetmaking as it is hard as well as PLIABLE and can 
be easily manipulated the smaller boughs 
form an excellent fuel for owing to the oil in 
them they burn like a torch and as the trunks 
of old trees are apt to become hollow many of 
them are only fit for the purpose the 
RJE is evergreen and the leaves fall after about 

three years being of course constantly replaced 
in the course of nature by younger ones the 
olive commences to flower at the base of its 
foliage the flowers gradually extending upwards 
the best crops are always obtained when the 
trees flower early and this occurs when the 
spring is mild as early as the month of march 
but the tree is susceptible to cold and if it gets 
checked it will flower as late as june in which 
case a failure of tho crop may be anticipated 
old trees usually yield a crop only every 
alternate year which is gathered in the autumn and 
early winter the largest trees are found in 
sicily where they grow almost like oaks and 
may be found measuring OF ft round the trunk 
the italian BLUEBOOK on agriculture 
published in 1874 names 300 varieties of the tree 
as existing in italy of which OF are found in 
the district of naples obviously in a country 
like italy where so many dialects are spoken in 
many cases the names of these varieties are 
purely local and as the same variety is called by one 
name in tuscany and by another at naples it 
would be absolutely useless to mention 
distinctions which have no difference in a report written 
for british readers 
olives are in fact divided into three classes 
namely i the small olive with few leaves which 
grows freely resists the cold better than the others 
is more free from disease grows on the poorest 
soil and though generally very hardy does not 
yield good oil and is useless for table purposes 
this tree will yield oil good enough for sharpening 
shears and for mechanical purposes generally 
and it will grow almost anywhere it is known 
by the names of miguda TRIOL cericiola and 
MARTINO in italy the second class known as 
OLIVE di SPAN has larger leaves a large and 
succulent fruit adapted for table use subject to 
the necessary treatment these trees require rich 
and good soil and no great vicissitudes of 
temperature they will not bear cold and are subject 
to a good many diseases it they get chilled the 
fruit falls and such berries as remain give but 
little oil and that of poor quality these 
varieties are supposed to have come to italy from 
spain and to have found a climate in italy which 
does not always agree with them they might 
all the same do well in the warmer climate of 
australia the third class is PREFERABLE for 
general cultivation as it avoids both extremes being 
hardy and at the same time producing a good 
and useful crop these PREKNOWN in italy by 
the names of RAZZER CARNIOLA ogliaroloj 
pigudoond MONOPOLES 
like the palm the olive flourish in many 
places where it will bear no fruit it will not 
yield in very hot places and it will not endure 
frost or sudden transitions from cold to heat it 
does not mind sea air and in many places on 
the mediterranean it grows to the waters edge 
where it must often be affected by salt and spray 
TWELVE degrees centigrade below zero 104 LEGS 
fahr is enough to wither the leaves and to kill 
such roots as are on the surface a late spring 
frost is naturally more harmful than a winter one 
where the wild olive tree grows it is a simple 
matter to transplant and graft it but this will 
not occur in the colonies for many years to come 
the olive also grows from seed and this in fact 
though it is a slow process is in the end superior 
to any other the trees do better live longer 
and are much less liable to disease than those 
propagated in any other way the seed will 
germinate in the second year if left to itself but if 
it is softened by being placed in a pap of clay and 
cow-dung and sown thus it will germinate the 
same year it is necessary to sow in thoroughly 
clean ground so as to allow a free and prompt 
expansion of the rootlets the ground should be 
dug three feet deep thoroughly cleaned and 
richly ANNUAL this should be done in the

PARSON implied ia the saving that a womans 
MAD and winter wind change oft would be 
UNINTELLIGIBLE to indian peasants for in their 
experience the direction of the wind is generally 
fixed by the tune of day and season of the year 
the difference between the position of woman 
in the east and west is very clearly reflected in 
proverbs th seclusion of women ai d their 
restriction to household affairs is expressed by 
the tamil proverb what has a frog in a well to 
do with the affairs of lire country applied to a 
woman who wants to know what is m the 
newspapers popular suspicion of female education 
is strongly put in the saying that it is better to 
marry a woman of bad character than one who 
has learned to read the indian proverbs HONT 
women are affected by the fact that in india we 
have no girls and young ladies we meet in 
india with female children and wives as the 
indian woman passes ATONE from being a child 
to being a wife but in europe young women 
have a fine time for their development both 
physical and intellectual before they get married 
in this transition period then there is a rich 
sphere for english proverbs hut as there is no 
such period in india there ARE no such indian 
proverbs india has accordingly no proverbs 
about flirting and court and as widows may 
seldom and never be remarried there are of course 
no indian proverbs about the dangerous wiles of 
widows on the LOOKOUT for husbands the 
despised and oppressed indian widow HAS little in

winter and in the spring the surface should be 
laid out in shallow trenches in which the seeds 
should be sown in rows about a foot apart with a 
distance between the seeds of not less than six 
inches the sharp end of the seeds should be 
upwards and they should be treated with a fair 
amount of water it is especially essential that 
the ground should be kept clean and all weeds 
immediately removed in the spring of the third 
year the seedlings may be moved to the nursery 
all shoots appearing on the tiny trunks having 
been carefully removed 
the most usual way of propagating the olive 
is by means of an egg-shaped fungus growth 
which is found upon its roots it is about the 
size and much the shape of any turkeys egg and 
grows onside the bark not more than two of 
fungi should be removed from a single tree 
or damage will be done to it indeed if 
propagation is attempted on a large scale it is better 
to sacrifice one tree altogether than to run the 
risk of injuring a greater number thus a 
hundred or more of these fungi can be obtained from 
a single tree in the winter besides a great number 
of slips and grafts in the spring when the tree 
can be felled and disposed of the removal of 
the fungus must be done with care the wood of 
the root round it must he carefully saw or chipped 
with a sharp axe a chisel must then be used to 
undercut the fungus and finally lift it out of its 
place the wood which adheres to it can then be 
ent off with a sharp knife if the fungus has 
plenty of eyes it may cut up like a seed potato 
but it is always advisable to make the pieces so 
large that each piece should have three or four 
eyes if the fungus has made any roots these 
should be carefully removed the best time to

WOLFF of belfast 
the following description of the briton will be 
interesting she is simply the most magnificent 
royal mail steamer in our whole mercantile 
MARINE crossing the equator and a perfect 
specimen of the highest class of modern naval 
architecture in the five steamers which constituted 
the COMPANY fleet in 1853 there was a little ship 
named the PURITAN but her quality may be 

IMAGINED from the fact that the tonnage of that 
entire fleet was 2327 tons the noble briton is 
herself 10300 tons burthen and a description of 
her splendid proportions may be completed by 
stating that she is 530 feet long OF feet broad 
and OF feet deep is a twin-screw with triple 
expansion engines the diameter of each set of 
cylinders being OF inches OF inches and OF 
inches and a length of stroke her 
indicated HORSEPOWER is 10000 there are OF 
furnaces with A boilers yet she is likely to prove 
reasonably economical with a coal consumption 
of 2500 tons per voyage out or home for all 
this the speed will at its best be OF knots the 
fleet of the union company consists of OF 
vessels A of them above 5000 and OF above 
3000 tons it was thought that the maximum 
was reached when the noma of 7537 and the 
scot of 7815 tons were designed but the 
briton as much surpasses them as they surpassed 
their predecessors in a wood she is the largest 
and finest vessel which HAS ever connected 
land with southern or eastern lands and ASHEN 
full she will have 1100 souls on board she 
might be spoken of as a floating town and palace 
combined beautiful to the eye in her white hull 
shapely lines slender masts and yellow funnels 
the briton bears the fullest scrutiny between 
decks in these days nothing must be spared in 
the fittings equipments and service of a great 
ocean liner and in these matters the BACON will 
bear comparison with the best it would be no 
consolation to a britons passenger complaining 
of lack of luxury or comfort to be reminded that 
a walk from bow to stern would mean exercise to 
the extent of a tenth of a mile the briton 
however is in truth superbly decorated and 
furnished the library or music room is of 
inlaid mahogany with teak and satinwood panels 
lighted by a lofty dome the glass covered with 
ornamental SCROLLWORK and illustrations in 
carved and other work of great poets and painters 
even the entrance passage is a copy from the 
choir stall of the gothic cathedral at ULM the 
smoking saloons are all on the same scale of 
splendour the first-class dining saloon scats 
172 passengers and there is another smaller 
saloon of the same class on the deck below 
for the full complement is 280 first-class 
passengers for the 182 second 122 third and 
320 steerage passengers there is accommodation 
on an equally liberal scale according to degree 
the second-class accommodation is equal to first 
upon many lines and better for third-class 
passengers we have never seen in any part of the 
world there are 750 electric lights and four 
huge refrigerating chambers for the preservation 
of the perishable stores the twin screws 
worked by independent sets of engines reduce the 
risk of a breakdown to an almost imperceptible 
minimum six of the twenty boats are of steel 
an l the LIFESAVING appliances are of the latest 
contrivance amongst the curiosities of 
construction the visitors were informed that in the 
hull of the briton there are 5600 tons of steel 
bound together by three-quarters of a million 
rivets and there is a double bottom extending 
the whole length of the ship capable of affording 
space for 1300 tons of water as effective and 
economical ballast better than that if the 
cuter shell were ripped off by accident the second 
floor would keep her afloat the well-filled 
library shelves are in the music saloon and 
contain of course a selection of the best and 
BRIGHTEST fiction a new and old and a very 
WELL CHOSEN collection of those standard work with 
i which busy people ARE so glad to renew 
acquaintance during the enforced idleness f the days at 
sea there is a delightful suggestion of 
PENDLE ie the quaint little btireux and 
writingtables here AND the PROUD roomy divans and 
ARMCHAIR s UPHOLSTERED i I DUV-toned blues dashed 

with TERRACOTTA are eminently suggestive of 
comfort and repose in the DAME of stained glass 
are portraits of great composers and poets while 
the carved teak and satinwood panels of the walls 
have heads in relief of authors artists and 
scientists rubber tiles a new and effective 
flooring are used in the PASSAGEWAYS to the 
cabins as well as in the smoke-room where the 
lounges and chairs are upholstered in dark-figured 
MOROCCO leather and a number of choice 
engravings are upon the walls

the s s safari with mails from

the DEAL mail steamer is due to 
arrive on the WITH inst bringing three weeks 
mails from europe 

on the arrival at PORTSMOUTH at the end 
of january last of h m s st george the 
late flagship of the cape squadron the 
HERS and crew were entertained by the 
or at a banquet in the town hall this 
HOMECOMING welcome to british sailors is 
unique the reason of it lies in the fact 
that the st george has seen more active 
service during her late commission than any 
other british warship of modern times 
she hoisted the pennant at PORTSMOUTH 
just over three years ago to relievo the 
LEIGH on the cope station within a few 
weeks of her arrival on the west coast it was 
found necessary to punish the natives of the 
brass district in the niger protectorate 
the expedition was composed of the st 
george WHEN and thrush six months 
later sho was engaged against MELI in the 
same district then came the 
demonstration at delagoa-bay which happily had no 
disastrous results 
the next war service the st george was 
engaged in was the bombardment of 
bar the details of which we all know 
NALLY the most serious of all THESE GEORGES 
expeditions was that against the king of 
benin just a year ago this resulted in the 
city of benin being captured after eight 
hours fighting 

a con-despondent has kindly furnished us 
with the following full account of the 
recent lawn tennis tournament 
the firstmatch in the tournament took 
place on friday the TH of february when

that the latter won easily in the RD and

wright met messrs CAINE and CALL and 
defeated them though the first set was a 
very even one score OF OF the first 
round was concluded on the WITH ultimo 
when messrs BLADEN and WHYTE won 
their match against messrs cornish and 
musters after a well contested three sets 
m which the two latter players lost the first 
set by three games won the second by I 
game and lost the last by I game score OF

the second round was started on the WITH

and easily defeated messrs baglehole and 
REILLY who were not playing up to their 
accustomed form 
finally last saturday messrs WHYTE and 
BLADEN played messrs cave and DENSE 
and this match was watched with the 
greatest keenness by the by no means small 
gathering of onlookers in the pavilion and

the gazette 

anticipated a really good contest messrs 
WHYTE and BLADEN won the first set A 
games to A and messrs cave and DENSE 
the second A games to A in the RD and 
winning set which was very close A games 
all having been scored it was decided that
