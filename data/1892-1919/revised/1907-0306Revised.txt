the current number of the geographical 
journal contains a paper on the seychelles 
archipelago by mr j stanley GARDINER 
my which will well repay perusal though 
written in a pleasing descriptive style the 
paper is crammed with facts some of 
which we summarize 
the archipelago consists of OF islands 
1100 miles from zanzibar 
MADE is the biggest and loftiest covering 
an area of OF square miles and rising to 
2993 feet 
there were no regular inhabitants before 
the advent of western peoples 
the archipelago was completely annexed 
l 
y the french in 175g and named after 
MOREAU 
sechellcs CONTROLLER des 
NARCIS 

the gazette 

the first settlement was established 
about 1709 for the cultivation of nutmegs 
and cloves 
the islands were captured in by 
h m y orpheus captain jiewcome and 
again in 1805 by h m s albion captain 
FEERIE finally ceded and england 1814 
present population 21000 birth rate 
OF f death rate 1771 OF per cent of deaths 
are from old age the regular tropical 
diseases are unknown 
rainfall 1008 inches average last OF 
YEARS at sea level 150 inches at an 
elevation of 2000 feet temperature of coast 
f in the mountains at night 
mr GARDINER has something to say 
about the staple industry of seychelles 
and the story is a sad one not without 
interest for us in any agricultural 
country he says a percentage of the profit 
should be set aside for the improvement of 
methods of cultivation and of the stock 
or plants and hn points out the folly of 
relying upon a single product os the 
CUELLES have done he looks forward 
however to a reaction against vanillin but 
on this point he is corrected in the 
discussion by professor duxstax who explained 
that vanillin was not strictly speaking a 
chemical substitute but the very 
substance to which the plant chiefly owes its 
aromatic flavour that chemistry had 
succeeded in producing from the oil of cloves a 
material vanillin which is identical with 
that found in vanilla and that vanillin can 
be produced more cheaply from oil of cloves 
than from vanilla ASA staple industry 
therefore vanilla is doomed though no 
doubt it will be able to hold its place in the 
colony as a subsidiary industry 

THE rising hope of the islands is rubber 
which has been established by mr DUPONT 
head of the botanic station its 
commercial success would seem assured but 
here again professor dukstax utters a 
word of warning he points out that a 
rubber tree may flourish as it does IU many 
parts of india but nevertheless 
producevery poor rubber the para trees in 
CUELLES are not yet old enough to test for 
their rubber-producing powers the 
economic depression from which the islands 
suffer is due in part to the code napoleon 
the law of the laud under which on the 
death of the owner the land is divided up 
among his children it is anticipated that 
m a few years the law of england will take 
the place of this to the advantage of 
individual ownership of property high tribute 
we may conclude is paid to the governor 
mr DAVIDSON one of the most 
enlightened of colonial administrators

against two defendants to recover OF

the value of a lost bale of kangas 
during the course of the action the EST 
defendant panachand VIRUS THE plaintiffs 
clerk at the time the cause of the action 
arose was with the consent of all parties 
withdrawn from the record 
the facts as they appear from the 
evidence are clear plaintiff had in the 
transhipment godown at the customs on the 
fgtli november CAB five bales of kansas 
awaiting transhipment on to the kaiser 
the defendant naranji was instructed to 
convey these in his lighter to the kaiser 
the five bales were accordingly loaded 
onto the lighter ANTHE WITH november the 
kaiser did not come in that day and it 
seems probable that naranji informed 
plaintiff that the baits would be out all night in 
the lighter any how it is certain that 
plaintiff knew on the WITH november that 
THE bales were going to be out all night in 
the lighter the kaiser arrived on the 
WITH and when the bales came to be shipped 
on the kaiser one bale was missing that 
is the bale for the value of which plaintiff 
sues the lighter owner the defendant 
RANDI 
it would appear at first sight that 
TON 151 of the indian contract act applies 
but in the case of the IRRAWADDY flotilla 
co rs bugwandas i l pi OF calcutta 
620 the judicial committee of the privy 
council held that the act was not INTENDED 
to embrace the case of common carriers 
the first question therefore to decide is 
whether or not a zanzibar lighterman is 
a common carrier in the case of liver 
alkali company us johnson l r A exch 
338 it is laid down that a person who 
exercises the ordinary employment of a 
lighterman by carrying goods in iris flats 
for reward although not bound as a 
common carrier to receive THE goods of all 
comers indifferently nevertheless incurs 
the liability of a common carrier for the 
safety of goods carried by him it is true 
that COCKBURN l c j in scaife vs fnvaui 
l b OF exch 358 thought that the 
ment quoted should be further considered 
but the case has not been OVERRULED and i 
am therefore bound by it ingate vs 
CHRISTEN A car and IS OF is another 
authority to the same effect the 
exclusion from the list of common carriers of 
persons who do not ply below distinct 
points such as an english cabman BRING 
rs dale A car p p 207 seems to be 
confined to land carriage see MACNAMARA on 
carriers art OF A p OF edition of 1888 
i bold therefore that under tho english 
law the defendant naranji is facie 
a common carrier 
if this view is correct the privy council 
case above quoted applies and THE indian 
contract act does not affect this case 
thus by the zanzibar order in council 
IGNI the defendants liability is question 
of english law 
there is a portion of the english law 
relating generally to carriers which deals 
exclusively with the liability of a carrier 
when he is acting AS warehouseman such 
law appears to me to fit this case and it is 
to bo found in chitty on contracts edition 
OF pp the cases there cited deal 

only with the responsibility of tho carrier 
after his actual carrying has finished in 
the present case we have to deal with the 
responsibility before the actual carrying 
has begun the principle however seems 
to be the same and the cases are i think 
al applicable 
MITCHELL vs lancashire and yorkshire 
lily l ik OF queens bench TO establishes 
that though the carrier gives notice to the 
consignee that beholds the goods at owners 
risk he is nevertheless liable to keep the 
goods with reasonable care and see 
crouch rs g ay k h and n LFS 
the question of that is reasonable care 
is a question of circumstances a good 
deal of reliable evidence has been given 
upon the question of special custom i 
find as a fact that it has been proved by 
this evidence to be the custom of lighter 
trade in zanzibar that where a lighter with 
goods is to bo out all night 
to so inform the owners of the goods in his 
possession and 
son to place a guard upon those goods if he 
requires one the custom of the river 
thames appears to be the exact OPPOSITE 
addison 
it has further been proved by the 
evidence that xaranji so informed the 
plaintiff on this occasion and according to the 
custom kept one man some times two men 
on the lighter to look after the lighter at 
night and to bale cut the water taking 
these circumstances together i find that 
naranji exercised reasonable care in this 
case and is entitled to judgment 
i ought perhaps to add that the 
defendants public notice bas not in my opinion 
been proved to have been properly 
published in any event being a denial of all 
liability as distinguished from a limitation 
of liability it is bad button rs J 
a c TH and lyon rs ALEUS o 438 
CLARITY pp LIE point however is 
not material to the case 
i give judgment for the defendant with 
the costs of both defendants against tho 
plaintiff counsels costs for mr aviggins
