as a rule they are fairly educated men for 
arabs and can generally read and write and are 
learned in the koran it might surprise 
pean readers to know what a WONDERFUL SUSTAIN 
of agencies they possess all over the soudan 
where of course regular posts are unknown 
and telegraphs undreamt of with their system 
of the ORGANS or fast mounted messenger who 
can travel enormous distances on a racing 
dromedary they get news through WITH astonishing 
rapidity even in troubled times as to the state 
of markets and the prices of commodities with 
this they are eminently secretive have a 
splendidly organised kind of freemasonry are capable 
of keeping interesting and important news 
locked up among themselves and are difficult 
people to pump they are very HARDHEADED 
keen men and might he called the scotsmen of 
africa though they are not ungenerous or 
unbending when their confidence is gained a 
foreigner to attain this object needs a perfect 
mastery of their tongue and the guile of a jew 
but these men know how to deal with LESS 
and accept with philosophic resignation a bargain 
m whichthe jew has had the best of them a 
thing which it is quite natural to suppose is by 
no means au infrequent occurrence 

the ordinary arab 

besides the ghadamsi the-ordinary arab as 
i call him although of many colours varying 
from pure black to white is a man of much 
inferior genius every arab thinks himself a 
born trader at least until he becomes rich when 
he turns into a small sultan however in the 
beginning he may have been a porter 
ploughman or camel driver and if an inflation of prices 
only occurs and tales of the fortunes netted by 
the arriving CARAVAN men are circulated he rises 
to the occasion and feels quite competent to 
undertake the financial management and the 
organisation of a caravan and can and does lind 
een jews to entrust to him their own pi more 
OLTON indeed somebody elses savings he 
starts AS n rule badly handicapped but it is a 
small concern to him as he stands to lose next 
to nothing he is generally a landed proprietor 
of some kind and possibly POSSESS a cow a 
well and a garden but the charms of his WIFI 
who at thirty has become an old hag please him 
little and his children those who have managed 
to survive have got themselves off his hands 
at an early age 
as their combined work did not open to him 
the road to wealth and to the paradise ho had 
been dreaming about while basking in the sun 
watching them work he decides to make a move 
and scrambles together oil his realisable effects 
in order to make a show of something towards a 
start and then goes on the hunt for capitalists 
as partners m a caravan venture his PHYSICAL 
condition is perhaps not always bad if lie is a 
country arab he would probably perspire rather 
FIELD after a brisk walk of a hundred yards or so 
in no may diminishes his faith in himself 
and the tlioughfof a 2000 mile stamp to the 
centre of africa in no way makes him feel AND 
sensation of funk he will get his TRAINING a 
lie goes on he believes in this system 
nary training is loss of time and quite 
unnecessary discomfort he will have a bad enough time 
of it m the beginning of the march without 
adding to it beforehand the arab is nothing if 
not selfconfident in anything relating to 
physical exercise for he has a sneaking belief that lie 
is the only man in the world with muscles and 
the power of using them an opportunity he is 
really willing to take AS seldom as possible 

the jew 

the eastern jew is of a race apart from his 
european brethren having as a rule to exercise 
jus talientson smaller objects arid INA smaller 

field than his more fortunate western BROTHER 
except perhaps his of the poorest 
quarters of the east end of london owing to his 
jack of general education lie could not compete 
with a board school boy of twelve but there is 
one department iii which ho would rarely fail 
to like a first prize against westerns of double 
ins age and that is in FINANCE as applied 
PRACTICALLY to his own person and profit 
the jew is a difficult and curious study 
COMPLICATIONS in property matters are bad enough 
m all conscience in england but they appear 
ELEMENTARY besides the wonderful system of the 
jews where a single house of TEDI rooms may 
have ten landlords and laws of inheritance are 
too mysterious to enter upon here the 
ordinary man who aspires to work eight hours a day to 
obtain his living cannot hope to compete with 
such a jew in business methods this man 
works with his head if not with his body at least 
sixteen hours a day in his moments of 
enjoyment his chief delight is calculating and in 
his loves and lovers meetings the only absorbing 
question is lucre shop shop and still shop is 
the eternal cry no other subjects interest him 
at all strongly except perhaps tile SAFETY of his 
own skin which is very tender and which lie 
looks after very carefully no INTELLECTUAL 
amusement incomprehensible to him he cannot 
understand any man fatiguing his brains unless 
there is money at the end of it the eastern 
jew has however some good points which it 
would he unjust not to cite he has strong 
affection for his children is faithful to his wife 
and strange to say is a firm believer in family 
ORG as any aristocrat his sympathy 
foishnrp tricks is certainly too large for our notions 
and in this respect what we might call moral 
obliquity is to him rather a sign of genius he 
HAS generally very keen judgment and is quick 
to seize an advantage and hold on to it and he 
carries exaggeration of language to a fine art 
these preliminary sketches of the people 
interested in the caravan trade will serve perhaps to 
give a better understanding of the manner IU 
which a caravan is ogarnisednot a true arab

trade 

the story of a caravan 

by edger j warble 

the idea of the great route starting from 
alexandria in the north and finishing at the 
cape which is the grandiose conception of mr 
rhodes promises to have a good chance of being 
successfully realised within the lifetime of most 
of us ft has already loft the sphere of mere 
speculation and from a utopian dream it has 
already developed into a practical scheme which 
mil certainly be earned out and perhaps sooner 
than is now thought it may be met by the 
almost equally great route from west to east 
from the niger COMPANY territories through 
the heart of the most populous part of central 
africa the advance of the niger company 
towards the east through SOKOTO and BORNU 
is jan accomplished fact and it may with 
certainty be now predicted that the trade of the 
ancient north caravan roads from tripoli OF 
barbary and BENGASI at one time almost the 
only way of penetrating to these countries will 
be quite extinguished and facilities are opened 
up to LIE west coast by the niger and to the 
EAT through WADAI and DARFUR to KHARTOUM 
it should be interesting to describe the 
manner in which the trade now menaced with 
extinction has been and is still carried on and also 
of the men engaged in it 
lord byron and other poets have often 
extolled the nobility of the arab character his pride 
and independence his loyalty to his friends and 
his implacable hatred of his enemies he 
undoubtedly does possess some of those qualities 
hut a long experience of practical business 
dealing with this supposed noble creature will make 
the poetic glamour WILI which he has been so 
long enshrouded look rather misty judge by 
the nineteenth century standard of civilisation 
his sordidness and rapacity wipe out a great deal 
of that glamour and present him in the guise of 
a semite to which race lie really belongs but 
withoutpossessing the intelligence of the jew 
an arab of any class oven the wealthiest has 
generally the soul of MONEYGRUBBER while 
affecting a scorn ho does not feel for lucre 
the ghadamsi tribe 

hero is one tribe however with a real 
capacity for business the ghnddmsi whose 
headquarters ARE in the town of glmdames about 
ton days camel journey from tripoli and close 
to the SOUTHEAST frontier of tunis and on the 
main route front tripoli to ghat and the 
ern soudan they have almost a monopoly of 
the northern caravan business and are far the 
most intelligent and wealthy of north african 
tribes they have their trade ramifications in 
ml the towns of the soudan while many reside 
in tripoli or have their agents THEREOUT 
almost invariably at the end of his trading career 
ghadamsi RETURNS OF his native town to end 
his days TWO are many reasons or their 
remarkable PREHEMINENCE in the caravan-trade 

few niggers about he will even pull off his 
houmous or blanket as if he meant to do 
something his secretary is with him and squats 
down in a corner and pulling out of a pocket 
a reed pen and ft dofteij or book which he 
spreads on his kneeswriting-desks are 
useless encumbrances to the arabproceeds now 
to take down the contents of each small bale 
as it is being made up in weights of about a 
HUNDREDWEIGHT and IT quarter each the toad 
CONSISTS of cotton piece goods t cloths 
shirtings prints some woollens mixed with tea 
coffee sugar small round mirrors in plenty 
the native beauties are as fond of admiring 
THEMSELVES in a glass as their more civilised 
sisters glass beads and a kind of shield in 
glass about two inches long with a hole in the 
top this process of packing goes on for weeks 
perhaps months any attempt to hurry the 
arab would only be fatal to his peace of mind 
and cause further delay for he is thoroughly 
enjoying himself now as a man of consequence 
and objects to shorten his pleasure by taking it 
at a gulp during this time he is attending the 
market once or twice a week on the LOOKOUT for 
camels or if he cannot get all he wants lie makes 
arrangements with natives of the interior who 
have brought stuff to tripoli and who would 
probably be returning to their own country 
empty and are only too glad to freight camels 
for a part of the journey this system is 
convenient to both parties and is often cheaper 
than buying all the camels at the moment of 
departure for they have generally to be exchanged 
at the end of the first stage in FEZZAN those 
employed in the colder northern country not 
being so suitable for the hotter climate further 
south 
a little dodge 

it would be a delusion to imagine however 
that all is ended with the packing and that 
there is nothing now but to make a start alas 
the arab finds he has no ready cash for the 
NEY not a sufficient number of the indispensable 
maria-Theresa dollars the current money of 
central africa which ds still coined in TRICOT 
for use there this of course means another 
call on the partners in the caravan for very 
little actual money is required on the way a few 
dollars covering all the necessary money 
penditnre cloth and trinkets forming the 
basis of payment on the march but the chief 
insists on having something in hand to avoid 
opening too many bales on the way it is a 
little DODGE little arab dodge to get 
something more than was at first bargained for and 
that is all and then the SENDS or contracts 
have to be written out and stamped and settled 
before the cadi this is done with the assistance 
of two native lawyers or ADOORS as they are 
called they come and sit down very solemnly 
with grave salaams very polite very learned 
and scribble through the necessary document 
with great celerity and ease long practice 
enabling them to fix the conditions with great facility 
and they are also expert in arranging the many 
difficulties which inevitably arise in making tha 
final arrangement suitable to both parties always 
on the basis of a compromise COMPROMISE in 
all business matters is the arab fetish fixity of 
conditions being an unknown quantity with them 
until they have gained or rather in most cases 
think they have gained some advantage which 
thy had not calculated upon however in 
some way when patience has been stretched to 
a point which would send the average 
man untrained to this sorb of thing to a lunatic 
asylum all is ready and a start is promised 

the start at last 

then th weather is carefully studied the re 

settled up and one fine morning a muster is 
made of a part of the caravan and they file out 
into the open ground in a long straggling line 
the last camels bearing the tents and a 
mysterious array of tin cans and water jugs hanging 
to the saddles after some embraces blessings 
and parting advices to relatives to the immense 
relief of everybody the last is seen of the long 
string of loaded camels and the idea which strikes 
one most while watching this stream 
looking like a line of meandering ants is how and 
when they are going to arrive at the end of a 
journey of some two thousand miles it looks 
like an everlasting adieu to the small fortune 
invested and you feel as if it would be quite safe 
to go home and make your will leaving tha 
result to your future GRANDCHILDREN however 
they do reach their destination and TLI do come 
back as I shall relate next week 

sunday CHRONIC 

the zoological exploration of 

the great african lakes 

owing to the unique and extremely 
interesting nature of the fauna in lake tanganyika 
the study of which was recently the object of 
an expedition supported by the royal society 
and led by mr j e s moore a committee has 
been formed consisting of sir john KIRK g 
c m g k c b f it s late british 
dent at zanzibar dr p l sclater f r s 
secretary to the zoological society mr 
thiselton-dyer c m g f r s director of 
KEW gardens prof ray LANKESTER f it s 
director of the natural history departments of 
the british museum and mr g a BOULANGER 
f r s of the british museum for the 
purpose of organising another expedition to the same 
regions to THOROUGHLY survey the basin not 
only of lake tanganyika but also the unknown 
portions of the northern extension of the great 
series of valleys in which tanganyika together 
with lakes kivu and the albert nyanza lie 
to collect specimens of the aquatic fauna and 
flora and to study the geological history of this 
part of africa the latter object of the 
investigation should be of especial interest for it 
was shown by mr moore that almost without 
exception the shells of the singular series of 
walk-like MOLLUSCS captured by him in 
ganyika are indistinguishable from those now 
found fossilised in europe among the remains of 
old jurassic seas it would thus appear that at 
some remote period of time the great valley of 
tanganyika was in connection with the sea and 
that the strangely isolated marine fauna which 
still inhabits its slightly brackish waters has 
remained there ever since so far only the 
medusae JELLYFISH the mollusca and the 
crustacea belonging to this antique fauna have 
been discovered in the-lake but when its vast 
size and depth are fully realised it is 
unquestionable that by far the larger portion of its 
fauna is as yet unknown 
tanganyika thus presents a unique field for 
scientific exploration at the present time and is 
indeed one of the few places now left upon the 
earth where animals like those peculiar to 
australia which have long since become extinct 
elsewhere may still be found 
another notable fact ascertained during mr 
MOORE last expedition was that the marine or 
halolimnic fauna OF lake tanganyika does not 
exist in either NYASSA or in lakes SHIRA MWERA 
bangweolo or any of the remaining lakes about 
WHITE anything zoological is KNOWN but it may 
yet be found in lakes kivu the albert edward 
and albert nyanzas which lie as has been said 
in an extension of the same great depression 
which contains the dead sea towards the north 

the probability of this being so is also increased 
by the curious fact that the fauna of tanganyika 
hears some resemblance to that of the lower 
portions of the nile 
during the present expedition it is therefore 
intended to go north from tanganyika which 
will form the zoological headquarters of the 
expedition through the unknown region which lies 
between tanganyika and lake kivu on finally 
to tho albert edward and RUWENZORI districts 
it is intended then that the expedition shall pass 
eastward through the uganda stations north of 
victoria nyanza down the uganda roads and 
railway to the sea mr MOORE previous 
EXPEDITION was hampered by the unexpected 
difficulties of transport and the want of a steamer 
properly to carry on DREADING and sounding 
operations in the lake and in consequence of 
this much valuable material particularly large 
specimens of entirely new species of fish had ta 
bo deliberately left behind at the present time 
however the african lakes corporation are 
running the london missionary SOCIETY old 
steamer once more upon the lake and all THESE 
deficiencies can therefore now bo overcome 
provided the necessary funds are raised 
a careful consideration of the details of the 
expenditure has led the committee to the 
conclusion that in order to enable mr moore to 
successfully lead another expedition for two 
seasons and to accomplish th above-stated objects 
a sum of not less than 5000 will be required 
the committee have already received 
encouraging offers of support including one of 1000 
from a gentleman connected with the commercial 
and political interests of british africa they 
point out however that tho results to be 
obtained will increase almost in the ratio of the square 
of the initial expenditure and in a private 
circular which has been issued the members of 
the committee appeal to those who feel interest 
in the objects of the expedition for assistance in 
carrying out an enterprise which is not only of 
the highest scientific importance but is also of 
great significance in securing british influence 
in a critical region of the african interior

mr leonard ASHBY the WELLKNOWN 
PROFESSIONAL hunter who has recently returned from a 
two monthstrip to the ZAMBESI river has been 
INTERVIEWED by our representative we print 
THE result at length as much of the no m TON 
elicited is of interest to the general reader 
apart from the sportsman 
i left beira accompanied by a friend about 
tho end of last october the hunting season is 
usually considered over in september but we 
had no occasion to complain of any scarcity of 
game thirty kafirs made up the party and 
our first destination was the OF mile on the 
beira railway thence we travelled in a north 
westerly direction within eight miles of the 
point mentioned the kafir kraals may be SAID to 
begin in earnest at no time were we more than 
a days journey from a native dwelling or se 
ELEMENT the COUNTRY affords magnificent 
inducements for cultivation on a large scale nearly 
every kraal boasts its own patch of ground 
under crop which varies from two to ten acre 
in extent rice of excellent quality is grown by 
the natives at all the kraals along the route in 
appearance this rice is not so white a the 
imported grain but if the proof of the pudding 
lies in the eating of it as an article of food the

native product is to be preferred it is 
moreover by far l he CHEAPEST whenever we 
purchased we paid at the modest rate of A milreis 
say IS gd per sack but this was seldom 
as we usually bartered NYAYA meat in 
exchange 
the kafirs also grow sweet potatoes 
pumpkins calabashes native broad-beans red beans 
a variety of pea mafoonda kafir corn and 
macbnbaala the grain of the latter is very 
much like millet in size and appearance from it 
is manufactured a native beer of much superior 
flavour AID quality to that made from kafir corn 
by the zulus and natives of natal it is a light 
wholesome and refreshing drink suited to 
tropical CONDITIONS and not quite so intoxicating in 
its effect as english ale the sweet potatoes 
are excellent the pumpkins though capital 
eating do not grow to any great size doubtless in 
consequence of deficient cultivation and the 
entire absence of manure the native beans 
and peas are both succulent and nourishing in 
point of flavour they compare favourably with 
those of local culture 
on the higher lands TOBACCO is grown most 
successfully but at present is mostly used for 
snuff making the art of curing the leaf decently 
for the purposes of smokers has yet to be 
taught 
there are practically no serious difficulties to 
discourage the idea of remunerative agriculture 
on a large scale the great desideratum is an 
efficient means of transport neither roads or 
bridges have as yet been constructed the 
numerous streams which intersect the country 
hare now to be negotiated by means of canoes 
or by wading the shallow drifts thousands of 
acres of well watered land suitable for rice 
growing are lying fallow on the higher slopes 
the tobacco plant which in other places receives 
expert care grows with no other attention than 
merely sowing the seed and bedding out the 
young plants 
the science of agriculture as understood by 
the kafir is practiced under the most primitive 
conditions the only implement used is a 
short pick with a handle about OF in long such 
as may be seen in the banyans shops in 
beira yet with this simple tool and a very 
moderate amount of labour the native maks 
his fertile little holding yield food enough and 
to spare to tickle the ground with a hoe and 
make it laugh with harvest obtains here a literal 
significance 
the picture is not overdrawn true the 
locusts have been a serious trouble in past 
seasons as elsewhere in south africa but the 
natives assured us that during the past two year 
the crops had suffered little or no damage from 
the depredations of these pests respecting the 
health of the district of course the demon 
malaria is only too well known but on this 
TIPIT is a noteworthy fact that not a single CASE 
of sickness was met with it is only fair to 
state however that the season is regarded by 
THC natives AS a phenomenally healthy one 
i have travelled more or less over this 
district every season since 1892 and my opinion as 
to the fertility of the soil and its suitability for 
agricultural settlement is the result of six years 
experience arid is by no means derived from an 
isolate trip in an admittedly favourable season 
taking the OF mile peg on the beira railway 
line as a starting point and travelling almost 
flue north towards the ZAMBESI river to a point 
about midway between sena and shnpanga the 
country presents an irregular ridge conformation 
virtually a WATERSHED falling abruptly towards 
the west on the one side and sloping gently on 
the eastern side towards the SEABOARD 
many streams intersect the territory on 
either side of the ridge those on the western 

slope running into the PUNGIE river or out on 
to the marshes whilst the waters of the easter 
slope wend their way to the ocean the western 
streams are not so numerous as those running 
east and in many instances they fail during the 
dry season the eastern streams may mostly 
be regarded as permanent 
there are several old camps left by the 
original surveyors of the beira-sena railway 
to be noticed along portions of the route these 
would indicate that their projected line was to 
follow the course of the ridge for at least a part 
of its distance 
the route however is not yet determined as 
a fresh survey is to be made although 
generally speaking the whole district is plentifully 
timbered the dense forest country begins about 
go miles from beira here the india-rubber 
vine grows in wild abundance it has never to 
my knowledge been cultivated at all but 
simply flourishes at its own sweet will climbing 
around trees of large growth and hanging in 
wiry tough festoons from branch to branch and 
trunk to trunk the natives have often to 
collect the rubber at a great height from the 
ground and much of it is actually inaccessible 
through the denseness of the tree growth if 
the vine were cultivated this would be obviated 
and its yield of rubber largely increased at 
present to gather a kilo a day is considered fair 
work for one kafir 
assuredly a great future lies before this 
portion of the mozambique province when 
developed into a rice maize tobacco and 
rubber-producing district as should happen when the 
beira-sena line taps these most fertile lands 
with regard to sport we were extremely 
fortunate considering the lateness of the season 
the principal items bagged were three elephants 
nine hippos six buffaloes five eland hulls three 
sable antelopes and an excellent variety of other 
game on two OCCASIONS the spoor of the black 
rhinoceros was noted but not followed up 
DANCES of the near presence of lions were very 
frequent but none were sighted the cover being 
too thick at this time of the year 
the natives were tractable and obliging 
being apparently quite contended with their lot 
it speaks well for the efficiency of portuguese 
rule that two strangers should he able to traverse 
so large a tract of country without the necessity 
of escort or precautionary measures 
the then COMMANDANT of the cheringoma 
district senhor francisco LUI moreira loforte 
was invariably obliging during the term of our 
stay in this paradise of the hunter the 
courteous treatment we received compels pur grateful 
recognition 
as already stated the health of the party 
continued excellent throughout the trip which 
taken altogether was both lucrative and 
enjoyable being such as rarely falls to the lot of the 
professional hunter during the off season

the shipment of coffee of poor quality 
despatched to antwerp from the congo free state 
last january has now been followed by a further 
shipment which experts declare to be a 
considerable improvement over the previous samples 
tested at the beginning of the year the congo 
coffee whilst resembling the CAMBRIC product 
cultivated in the portuguese colonies in africa 
is said to he far superior to it it has a 
pleasant although somewhat unusual taste and by 
admixture will facilitate the burning process of 
other and better qualities of berry where the 
flavour is not affected the tests made show 
generally that considerable progress has been 
made in the method of cultivation and treatment

figuratively speaking she is like a diamond set

wedded to virtue as a general rule where we 
find beauty we do not find virtue and where we 
find virtue we do not find beauty nothing but 
singular good luck endows a person with both 
virtue and beauty and it must be a womans rare

the future of africa 

there is perhaps no subject which leads to 
such diversity of opinion not only between 
politicians and armchair philosophers at 
home but also between men of actual 
experience in africa as the question of its 
future on the one hand we hear glowing 
accounts of the great empire which 
britain is to weld out of her african 
possessions of the primary necessity of 
tain securing these potential trade areas 
for the benefit of future generations and 
on the other we are told that our african 
possessions are a white elephant that they 
are made up of fever swamps for tho most 
part and that with the exception of the 
cape and the nile valley our vast african 
territories are a huge encumbrance 
THE the first party or the second is right 
we will not presume to say POSSIBLE we may 
be allowed to hazard tho opinion that both 
parties being extremists are equally wrong 
and that the truth lies in that IIA TRAIN 
which is so hard to find but so easy SPEAK 
about again it may be taken as certain 
that africa will not yield up its treasures 
mineral or vegetable without the judicious 
expenditure of capital and the liberal 
expenditure of energy the same qualities 
which are needed in canada or australia 
are required in africa but to an even greater 
degree and the sooner people at home 
realise as they have to a certain extent 
realised in the case of australia that it is the 
very worst thing they can do to send their 
uudersirables out here the better not only 
for themselves and for the UNDESIRABLES 
but also for tho country they are sent to 
the value to britain in tho future of 
tropical africa depends therefore not upon 
adventitious aids but upon the amount of 
foresight and energy we spend wisely in 
developing our various possessions SOMETHING is 
certain we along with othereuropean nations 
are here and the practical question lies 
before us that we must make the best of our 
bargain whether it turn out good or bad in 
the long run having accepted these 
responsibilities we must bear them honestly 
and not try to back out and leave things 
worse confounded than when we found 
them in considering the future of tropical 
africa THE should try and work from facts 
and not from visionary theories and while 
numbers of people are expatiating on the 
various products which might be grown we 
THINK that the hard won experience of b 
c a is not sufficiently taken into account 
so for as wo are aware a great deal more 
stress should bo laid on the fact that b c 
a has got an export most of tho other 
parts of tropical africa depend for their 
revenue upon some article indigenous to the 
country like rubber IVORY which is 
onlylimited in quantity or upon such native 
products as oil seeds which are grown by 
the native and in which the white man 
simply PLANS tho part of the temporary 
trading resident here however we have 
a planting industry and the nucleus of a 
stable planting population capital has been 
sunk the country and despite all that 
can be said against the industry by 
pessimists the results have been moat 
ENCOURAGING common sens would therefore 

march A 1899 

march A 1899 

g 
argue that such an industry should be helped 
as possible by government and we believe 
such help would be forthcoming if the real 
state of matters were known the fact is 
we are too unassuming we want to 
advertise ourselves more and draw more 
attention to what has been done in the 
past and what could be done were more 
capital available we are glad to see that 
government has adopted a much better 
attitude towards the planting industry but 
strange to say they have not yet seen the 
heed for an expert agricultural chemist 
although nearly every other tropical 
country is finding out that he is essential 
and what is more in most cases getting 
THIS essential supplied however we need 
not despair when government has gone the 
length of a commission to enquire into 
malaria that was a step in the right 
direction and as mr HALLIWELL letter points 
out all residents in b c a are grateful 
to mr secretary chamberlain for his 
consideration still we repeat when dr 
morris can be sent to revivify the 
languishirig industries of the west indies 
ment ought to remember the old adage 
that a stitch in time saves nine and that 
when private capital and industry have 
founded an export in tropical africa such 
an industry should he encouraged as far as 
possible the same argument applies to 
the railway and it seems to us very hard 
that uganda which has cost so much in 
blood and treasure should get its RAILWAY 
before it even has a single export while we 
here are left out in the cold it will of 
course he said that there is a political 
reason for the uganda railway hut the same 
may he said of b c a while there are 
enormous difficulties to be overcome in the 
case of uganda in b c a we have every 
natural facility the solution of the 
RICA question lies in such industries as the 
coffee planting of b c a and with a 
thousand ton crop before us we should 
pluck up energy to go ahead and if possible 
win that recognition which we believe we 
deserve THE central african times

it will not be long before the german 
mombasa and muscat pice disappear 
altogether from zanzibar for since the notice 
issued by the government prohibiting 
their use and circulation all merchants and 
SHOPKEEPERS have been busy sorting them 
out and disposing of them though not 
without a good deal of grumbling and loss 
it is a great pity that the smaller shop 
keepers and natives have to suffer from the 
greed of larger importers
