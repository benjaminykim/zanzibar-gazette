on tuesday february RD the auction of 
the new town plot leases took place at 
kampala when some exceedingly high 
figures were reached there were OF 
different lots sold the upset price of each 
being rs OF at whatever price the plot 
is knocked down that sum is the ground 
rent payable to government yearly for a 
term of OF years after which the 
ment have the option of taking over the 
plot and compensating for all substantial 
buildings then on the land 
the auction commenced punctually at 
OF am and it was soon obvious that no 
plots were going to he knocked down for the 
upset price and that some keen bidding 
would take place for the plots facing the 
market 
rs 150 rs 300 and rs 350 were soon 
reached and the bids still kept rising until 
rs 400 was reached and passed the highest 
figure being finally reached at plot no I 
of block c which fetched rs 435 no less 
than six plots fetched over rs 400 each 
and altogether the sale was the largest and 
most successful over held in the 
rate 
to people who know kampala it may be 
of interest to hear that the new town site is
