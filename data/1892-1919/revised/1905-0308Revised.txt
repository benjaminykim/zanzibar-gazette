the following arlielc which appears in 
the times will interest mariners on this 
COAST COUNT of enquiry was held at 
port elizabeth cm december A and A IHP 
to investigate the CIRCUMSTANCES attending 
the casualty which occurred to the british 
steamship tismorc off zitzikama point 
on november LL the court 
placed on record their opinion that there 
wore several places on the coast in need of 
survey there was they state a wreck 
ROCK off bird island which had never 
been located mid only the other day a 
ship came to grief there the suffolk 
foundered off zitzikaina point and no 
trace of her had been found a vessel 
foundered off cope AGULHAS and the 
mexican struck some obstacle not 

mentionthe gazette 
ed on the chart in the same place HER 
had been several wrecks to the west ot 
recife in fact nearly the whole coast 
line from delagoa bay to cape AGULHAS 
needed a now survey which SHOUT be 
carried out as early as possible 

we glean the following from the 
interesting notes kindly given us by mr a dudley 
YORKE about his trip to Kelima-near he 
calls the mountain a colossal 
disappointment to the globe trotter and to everybody 
else including germany and the natives 
he did not reach the summit owing 
apparently to the fact that he did not have 
hans MEYERS map which plainly shows 
the route which as far as is known at 
present is the only one practicable to the 
snowcap without cutting steps the rest of 
the ascent appears easy Kelima-near 
cannot therefore bo considered an alpinists 
mountain unless the lesser peaks be tried 
these are still unconquered in spite of 
several attempts in fact the chief 
attraction to the alpinist must be the opportunity 
of getting to close on 20000 feet with less 
trouble than perhaps ou any other 
mountain KONIA and iluwenzori offer much 
nobler game 

to the botanist unless he be specially 
interested in ferns Kelima-near offers 
nothing of unusual interest the fact that 
strikes one most is the singular resemblance 
of the flora above the forest level to that 
which we associate with europe the 
entomologist will ind very few butterflies 
above a certain level tliougb judging from 
experience there must be plenty of stinging 
insects still unclassified there are many 
birds though small and dull coloured as 
regards sport and zoology mr dudley 
YORKS party only saw ONE mammal 
though they came across numerous tracks 
of warthogs buck and zebra near the 
snowlevel 

the most unpleasant feature about 
Kelima-njave is getting THERE there ARE 
two ways from PANGA the post takes ten 
days the usual route is by yoi and TAVEDA 
including LILY miles of waterless country 
and two STATIONS where the black anopheles 
and tsetse abound the way lies across an 
almost shadclrss l IIN the road is really 
good but scarcely rises anywhere to more 
than 3000 feet the average being 2500 
which is still hot enough on the equator 
at MOSHI there is a sudden climb to about 
1000 feet but coming back the party found 
it pleasanter though longer to go bykilcma 
and MARANG on the mountain side 

the country round TAVEDA though 
malarious abounds with game across 
from yoi every ten days a greek sends 
two donkey wagons whether owing to the 
tsetse or hard usage the mortality among 
donkeys is very great the POWERS also 
suffered severely from heat and thirst 
with the sudden changes of altitude the 
rain damp and other disagreeable 
circumstances we may consider ourselves fortunate 
at having had only seven cases of fever and 
being delayed only two days it is essential 
that hooks and instruments he got from 

march A 1905 

home had we had better information we 
might have done better but the most 
striking CIRCUMSTANCE of the journey was the 
difficulty we found in getting particulars 
of such a well trodden road it may he 
useful to future travellers to know that 
two fine sleeping hags originally 
BELONGING NANSEN who gave them TO hans MEYER 
are to he found at MOSHI also two 
alpenstocks we left behind we left yoi on 
WITH january arrived at MOSHI the WITH 
reached the cave WORD made our attempted 
ascent WITH and got hack to yoi on RD 
february 

judging from the above mr dudley 
YORKE seems to consider the whole trip not 
worth trying without wishing to criticize 
his opinion wo cannot help thinking that 
his verdict of a colossal DISAPPOINTMENT is 
rather severe to the european 
alpinistaccustomed to the comforts of a train de luxe 
which takes him right up to the foot of 
the peak he wishes to climb it is natural 
that unexpected hardships and vexatious 
delays should he rather trying but 
allowance has to he made for the undeveloped 
state of the country and the fact that 
Kelima-jar is very near the equator which 
accounts for the anopheles tsetse and the 
still unclassified stinging insects sickly 
donkeys instead of powerful locomotives 
and feverish porters in lieu of the 
picturesque SWISS guides ready to take the 
traveller UNDER their paternal care the 
german government are doing their best 
to develop the country and we have no 
doubt that in years to come either the 
mombasa or tanga railway will bring 
that majestic mountain within easy reach 
but even in its present state the country 
presents many features of great interest 
and in spite of the little diawbaeks 
which inevitably attend all expeditions in 
an undeveloped tropical region it does 
not deserve being called a colossal 
disappointment oven from a GLOBETROTTERS 
point of view 

last month was the driest february we 
have had since 1899 only 008 inches of 
of rain being recorded in town at bangs 
there was no rain at all during february 
the only recorded instance wo believe in 
zanzibar island of a month passing without 
rain the country though dry AND thirsty 
is not as yet seriously suffering from want 
of rain 

the finals in the badminton tournament 
and croquet handicap which were going on 
at the NAZI MOSA sports grounds during 
the whole of last week were played off on 
saturday last the result of the croquet 
handicap was a win for mrs DURAND 
and mr becher the scratch couple after a 
series of closely contested games mrs 
maokiimon and mr SINCLAIR vicing the 
runners up in the badminton 
tournament the EST place was secured by mrs 
mead mr SWINERY and mr brown the 
runners up who were only one point 
behind were mr WILMOTT mr FAIRE and

a putting competition for ladies was also 
got up on saturday afternoon and proved 

jet-Ali IU o 

very popular the prizes which were 
presented by mr BAUGHMAN were carried 
off by mrs FAIRE first and mrs bardo 
second 
the playing off of the tournament 
finals was made the occasion of a NOZI 
MOSA club at home THE e was a 
large attendance of members and their 
friends and altogether the afternoon passed 
off pleasantly and SUCCESSFUL 

from a recent parliamentary paper 
africa no OF of 1901 we learn that the 
trade of the british east africa 
rate for the year ending march OF 1901 
amounted in the aggregate to 734182 
compared with 848720 for the previous 
OF months imports declined from 700360 
in 1903 to 001337 in 1901 the fall being 
chiefly accounted for in imports on behalf 
of the east africa administration and the 
uganda railway though there is a slight 
falling off in traders goods and specie 
exports on the other hand rose from 
148060 in to 159815 in 
the expansion being chiefly due to increased 
deliveries of ivory horns hides etc
