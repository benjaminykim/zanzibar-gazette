the WAIT in view of the indecisive war 
operations and the intense cold and also the 
exhaustion both physically and financially of 
turkey and the allies the idea of effective 
mediation by the powers for peace is gaining 
ground turkey is willing and a movement on 
the part of the allies is awaited 

HAKKA pasha has informed REUTERS that his 
mission to london is merely SEMIOFFICIAL and he 
declared that the turks wanted the territory of 
thrace in order to make constantinople 
mora and the dardanelles secure against 
NOBLE this was one of the points on which 
they insisted and in which they asked europe to 
intervene because peace resulting direct from 
negotiations with the belligerents was apparently 
out of the question they insisted on retaining 
the aegean islands

dowager empress died on saturday morning 
after a brief illness which was probably 
appendicitis 

during the last few days prior to her death she 
had occasional periods of acute illness rumours 
that she committed suicide spread owing to the 
impending transfer of the imperial family to the 
western palace in order to make room for the 
government at the eastern palace but as the 
dowager empress herself suggested the transfer 
this would seem to entirely disprove the suicide 
theory 

the suffragettes mrs PANKHURST 
speaking at CHELSEA reaffirmed that she would take the 
responsibility for the outrages and defied the 
government a representative of the home

quarter which had been left locked by the 
occupants and owing to the high wind which 
prevailed at the time the fire spread with 
alarming rapidity through mtendeni 
tangamembweuiup to the yikokotouidistrict 
unfortunately the tide was low and ALTHOUGH 
the fire engine was quickly on the spot the 
tire was beyond the range of the hose and 
the only means of keeping the conflagration 
within limits was by unroofing all thatched 
houses within the threatened area the police 
who were assisted by some hundreds of 
voluntary helpers did all that was possible 
to check the spread of the flames but when 
the tide had risen sufficiently to permit of 
the effective use of the fire engine many 
houses in the vikokotoni district were 
burning 

this was the first occasion on which the 
new motor engine had been used and when 
once within range its effectiveness was 
quickly apparent and by A oclock the outbreak 
was well under control 

the number of huts actually burnt is 
returned at 148 but if those unroofed and 
damaged by water are also taken into 
account the loss to the native population 
is considerable the cause of the outbreak 
is unknown but in the light of subsequent 
outbreaks later in the week there would 
appear to be good reason for the theory that 
it is the work of an incendiary a similar 
outbreak occurred within this area in 
ber last 

on thursday two fires occurred one at 
kisimajongo at 130 oclock and another later 
at kibokoni which resulted in the destruction 
of OF houses to the low tide in the 
creek the lire engine was once more 
ineffective 

o 

on friday again the police were called to 
another outbreak at vikokotoni at A p m 
on this occasion some six houses were burnt 
down in close proximity to the scene of 
days conflagration

zanzibar sailing club 

the third and last race for the cup 
presented by the zanzibar government was 
sailed over the usual course to the south of 
shangaiii point on saturday EST instant 

four boats entered and when the starting 
gun was fired tit A p m there was hardly any 
wind and the start was in consequence a 
very poor one 

the run to the first buoy moored off 
kiungani beacon occupied nearly an hour 
the boats at times being becalmed but 
at about A oclock a breeze sprang up from the 
north and enabled all the boats to 
complete the first round soon after 

the breeze however soon lost streng 

and the second round took about an hour 
lulu crossing the line at and 
winning on her time allowance 

lulu having been placed second in each 
of the previous races secured the greatest 
number of marks and her owners messrs 
clarke and lofting are to be congratulated 
on her success in winning the cup 

the captain and officers of the c s 
SHERARD OSBORN very kindly placed their 
ship at the disposal of the club and mr 
saw of the same ship very kindly acted as 
officer of the day
