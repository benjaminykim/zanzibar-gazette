queen victoria 

an appreciation 

the following appreciation of queen 
victorias character by one who knew her long 
appeared in the TIMEX on the BOTH january 
a very interesting feature in the personal 
records of queen victoria is the striking continuity 
of her character it is almost astounding to 
find how closely and in how many respects she 
who died in 1901 as the aged mother of her 
people resembled the girl-queen of 1837 
four years developed but did not change her 
character the sweetness combined with dignity 
which so impressed her court at the beginning 
of her reign was reflected till its very close in 
her unfailing loving sympathy and tenderness 
of heart her own journal revealed to her 
people how great a part deep affection and 
devotionlove in factplayed in her life in 
those days of which she has given AS the record 
love for her husband love for her children 
love for friends love for places her heart 
was brimful of love and the long years through 
which she lived never seemed to dull or exhaust 
it nay it seemed to expand and take in all her 
people 

but equally continuous was her strength her 
resolute insistence or what was right indeed it 
has been who-pored that that resolute assertion 
of her ROYAL will and rights which the young 
queen displayed in the case of the ladies of 
the bedchamber and in the case of lord 
SOON in 1851 did not fail to manifest itself in 
other less WELLKNOWN instances in which ministers 
found that they had to deal with a very 
determined woman but this strength of will can 
only heighten the admiration which all the world 
has felt for the strictly constitutional limits 
within which the queen moved the true 
understanding of the duties of a constitutional 
monarch and the resolve to observe them 
faithfully have in her case kept any instincts of 
selfwill in check a weak sovereign might more 
easily endure constitutional trammels the 
queen a strong sovereign not without a strain 
of peremptoriness in her character must many 
JI time have been sorely tried by the trammels 
imposed on her ROYAL will but ministers never 
had to complain that directly or indirectly she 
endeavoured to break through their toils 

on the great ability of the queen it is 
needless to dilate men of all classes who have been 
brought into contact with her have borne 
testimony to it but strong common sense was no 
doubt one of the dominant characteristics of 
her mind which was clear rather than subtle 
on many subjects she would take what may be 
described as a feminine view on some like many 
strong men she no doubt had prejudices but 
her opinions were always valuable and 
wellexpressed while her immense experience and 
wonderful memory gave her an advantage over 
nearly all the statesmen with whom she had to 
deal a reign of OF years yet the capacity of 

recalling all its main incidents VIVIDLY and clearly 
to the last 

it is very remarkable too and shows the 
breadth and the elasticity of the queens mind 
that she should have lived through such 
extraordinary economical social and political changes 
and yet have been able to comment on the latest 
developments with freshness and understanding 
without the narrowing effects of retrospect or 
of notions imbibed when totally different 
ideas and different standards of life and action 
prevailed no modern reformer belonging to 
the latest generation of public men could take a 
deeper or more sympathetic interest in all 
questions affecting the masses and dealing with the 
condition of the people than the queen 

no better index to the mental and moral 
qualities of the queen exists than those 
utterances in letters and messages with which the queen 
has favoured her people collectively or honoured 
recipients of her friendly sympathy individually 
there is about them an extraordinarily personal 
ring which makes them infinitely precious but her 
pen had not only the power expressing sympathy 
and touching the deepest chords of a nations 
heart by its tender and womanly solicitude it 
could express other matters very plainly her 
personal letters have been described as extremely 
vigorous with MUCH accentuation of important 
passages and bringing out into unmistakable 
relief points on which she insisted and with 
little toning down of unpalatable truths if the 
occasion required that they should bo told 

one personal characteristic of the queen may 
not be very generally known her prolonged 
mourning and seclusion after prince alberts 
death her constant anxieties and heavy 
responsibilities might be thought to have given a tone 
of permanent melancholy to her whole nature 
but it was not so the queen could often be 
very cheerful interested in all that was passing 
conversing brightly with those around her and 
not without enjoyment of humorous stories 
the human element in all its phases was very 
strong in her 

much has been written about the family life of 
the QUEENA life almost patriarchal in many 
respects her own graphic description of her 
joys and sorrows in the days when her husband 
still gave brightness and gladness to her 
existence will recur to all who have followed her 
personal history and her own delight in joys 
of family life infused into her affectionate heart a 
very tender and womanly interest in the homes 
and happiness of all to whom she was attached 
nothing could be more pathetic or more touching 
than her consoling soothing wordsfree from 
all false sentiment and exaggeration yet 
profoundly humanfor those on whom sorrow had 
fallen by the death of those they loved she 
understood the depths of grief the gaps in 
families and would write as the friend who had 
suffered similarly herself there was infinite 
pathos in her own life and she felt with the 
truest insight what was pathetic in those of 

others never was there a simpler more 
womanly more human queen and yet a queen 
with unrivalled powers of STATESMANSHIP and a 
real strength of character in which no king has 
surpassed her 

max NORDAU on the war 

hitting the nail on the head 

on new years day there appeared in the 
NEE FREE PRESSED vienna over the signature 
of max JORDAN an interesting article on the 
south african war in the course of which he 
SAYS behold the rare spectacle of the 
whole world being at one in condemning british 
policy we see a massed and terrible hatred of 
the english who by many are considered no 
better than COLDBLOODED robbers and murderers 
on the other hand the british nation has almost 
unanimously declared for the policy of its 
present government with which it means to share 
the moral responsibility for the war so 
convinced is nearly everyone in england of the 
justice of the british cause that i think if we 
except mr stead there is not a single prominent 
politician or writer in england who would be 
ready to subscribe to another gladstonian 
MENTION of pretoria the unanimity of a nation 
like the english in a case in which LIE whole 
world is also unanimous in condemning british 
policy ought to make sensible men reflect 
because the english after all were for centuries 
a bulwark of freedom they are a nation whose 
sense of justice and equity is proverbial whose 
high civilisation only a fool would deny and 
whom to treat as a band of robbers and thieves 
is such an absurdity that only bad faith or utter 
imbecility could be guilty of it anyone not 
led by blind hatred and with enough reason 
left in him to reflect will find in seeking for the 
cause of british pertinacity in this war that 
england is simply actuated by a very natural 
motivenamely the instinct of self preservation 
to understand this however one must know 
methodically the boer had made their preparations 
for driving theenglish into the sea how since 
the death john brand the dutch of south africa 
sought the means of driving out the english 
first by the illtreatment of the UITLANDERS and 
at the right moment by using force and how 
tho motto africa for the africans was 
interpreted to mean south africa for the dutch and 
there is no place here for the english other 
nations may be indifferent about it but the 
lish are convinced that they must not lose south 
africa not only is their territory there five and 
a half times as large AS germany not only are 
there one million settlers of english blood or 
english speech and space for a hundred times 
as many british settlers but SOUL africa 
INSTILL the most important station en route to india 
and australia its possession in english hands 
is almost a condition of the possession of india 
and the defence of australia its loss would 
therefore inevitably bring about the disruption 

and his majesty doth strictly change and 
command that no edition of the common 
prayer be from henceforth printed but with this 
amendment and that in the meantime till 
copies of such edition may be had all parsons 
vicars and curates within this REALM do for 
the preventing of mistakes with the pen 
correct and amend all such prayers in their 
church-books according to the aforegoing 
TON and for the better notice hereof that this 
order be forthwith printed and published aud 
sent to the several parishes and that the bight 
reverend the bishops do take care that 
obedience be paid to the same accordingly

one that is which is at the root of all human 
relationsbritish policy must be what it is 
simply the questionyou or i to those 
ii unanimous persons who ask why is not the 
j RUNZA you and i used i would simply reply 
address yourself first to the boers because it 
was they who wanted to exterminate the english 
in SOUL africa and until they succeeded to 
make at least helots of them whilst the english 
offer the boers full british freedom and as much 
independence as any loyal subject of the queen 
ENDS in the british colonies no englishman 
ever thinks bf depriving the boer of his place in 
the south africa sun there is no doubt that 
the south african undertaking is a terrible ordeal 
for england and there is no lack of prophets who 
triumphantly foretell that it will be the grave of 
the british world-power i am not of that 
opinion because england under elizabeth and under 
george iii had to face far more terrible dangers 
and overcame them and i am convinced she 
would rather spill the last drop of her blood than 
allow herself to be ousted from her present 
position in the world and highly as i appreciate 
the heroism of the boers i find the heroism of 
the english deserves just the same admiration 

should still have enough provisions to return to 
wards SPITZBERGEN before winter set in the 
point of the whole thing is that i intended to 
reach the POLE say i ought to get there in 
150 days but i have allowed 180 for the purpose 
if i leave franz JOSEF land when the sunrises 
this would still leave allowing 180 days for the 
journey ten days of remaining light for me to 
travel towards SPITZBERGEN at theexpiration 
of this time i should put myself in winter 
quarters on the ice kill the remaining reindeer for 
food and all the dogs not required for the rest of 
the homeward journey in the spring by this 
means i should hope to reach SPITZBERGEN in 
the early summer before the breaking up of the 
ice my arrangements are now all completed 
for the BEHRING sea route and will be submitted 
to sir WILFRID LAURICE on my return i shall 
take with me from OF to OF MENELL scientists 
and none of them merely sailors or labourers 
i have already received numbers of applications 
from england canada and the united states 
captain VERNIER adds that lie attaches

a canadian polar expedition 

renters representative has had an interview 
with captain joseph c VERNIER of quebec who 
is now in england in connexion with his proposed 
expedition to the north pole he has practically 
completed his arrangements in england and hopes 
to leave for canada in a few days discussing 
his proposed journey captain BEVIER said 

I have two plans to lay before the canadian 
government on my return each of which are 
based upon my long personal acquaintance of 
arctic seas and have been approved by the best 
arctic authorities my first plan is to start by 
way of BEHRING straits following the coast of 
siberia and enter the ice between 165 aud 170 
degrees of longitude east i shall then push 
north as far as the ice will permit when my 
ship gets into the ice i shall place myself in the 
hands of nature if she gets into a better position 
than the track of the jeannette i shall expect to 
reach the pole and return in between three and 
four years this will not be so difficult as in the 
case of the jeannette because the polar basin at 
the present lime has more openings than in past 
years this being due to the changed climatic 
conditions my second plan which HAS already 
been privately submitted to the quebec GOGRA 
PICAL society is to start from franz JOSEF 
land with a large number of dogs and reindeer 
and travel during the summer to the pole 
SLEIGHS taking with me concentrated provisions 
and killing my reindeer day by day for food 
elaborate calculations have been made as to the 
number of dogs and reindeer required for 
sleighing and for food travelling at an average of 
six miles per day the journey to the pole should 
occupy 150 days at the end of which time i

the plaintiff sued to recover from the 
defendant es 10000 being damages for 
personal injuries sustained through the 
negligent driving of the defendants trolly 
by the defendants servants in which the 
plaintiff was travelling 

the original suit was decided by the 
learned judge of tho east africa 
orate court at mombasa who found a 
verdict for plaintiff and assessed the 
damages at rs 1000 from this decision the 
defendant now appeals 

judgment 

in this appeal wo have no doubt that the 
plaintiff suffered injury at the hands of the 
defendants servants through the negligent 
driving of the GAURI in which she was 
travelling and which plied for public hire 
between kiliudini aud mombasa we can 
have no doubt that the accident occurred 
from want of care on the part of the 
FONDANTS servants when descending the hill 
near the fort and that the GHAZI was driven 
at such a rate that it was not under 

PRO 

the gazette 

march g 1901 

while upholding therefore the learned 
judge with regard to his finding that the 
accident was occasioned by the negligence of 
the defendants servant we order that the 
damages for the injuries sustained be reduced 
to es 500 and that each party pay their ow 
costs in this appeal

per control and that by this negligence the 
collision occurred with some hand cart that 
was crossing the tram line it has been 
suggested by the defence that the plaintiff 
refused to alight at the ticket station the 
usual place of debarkation and that us she 
had only booked to this point she was a 
TRESPASSER beyond and therefore the 
FONDANTS ARE not liable 

the evidence however seems clearly to 
indicate that the pace the GAURI was driven 
at prevented its drawing up at this point 
VIRTUE ticket station and that the impetus 
carried the GHAZI beyond it to the actual point 
where the COLLISION occurred we are of 
opinion that this collision occurred solely through 
the negligence of the defendants servants 
and not by any contributory negligence of 
third parties namely those responsible for 
the hand cart which it has been suggested by 
the defence was crossing the line and ought 
to have got out of the way 

the only question that remains for us 
to decide therefore is the quantum of 
damages with regard to this we must 
consider very carefully the report of dr 
MACDONALD on whoso medical evidence the 
plaintiff principally relies it appears that 
when she was examined by dr MACDONALD 
he states in his report written at a time 
when the whole matter would be very 
CREATIN his mind and well considered that she 
never mentioned the fact that she had 
suffered previously to the accident from the 
very complaints that she alleged to him 
were caused by the accident

dr MACDONALD report states that she 
was suffering from internal THOU BLE which she 
attributes SOLI to the accident and that prior 
to her accident she was IU excellent health and 
suffered from none of these complaints from 
the evidence of the doctor EMET ALI who 
treated her before tho accident it is clear t 
west bv tho sea on the north 
that she was then suffering tor the very 
same complaints that she told dr I premises o the 
aid had been brought on by the accident 

and secondly all those valuable 
godown premises in the town of 
ZIHAR in the SHANGAN district now in 
the occupation of messrs smith 
KENZIE and co and used by them as 
coal godowns and bounded on the 
by the 
ice factory on the 
east by godowns of messrs smith 
mackenzie co and on the south by 
a lane 

we have no doubt in our minds that this 
was so and that she tried to lay to the door 
of tho accident her former ill health in this 
particular taking all the medical 
evidence into consideration we entirely agree 
with the learned judge of the lower court 
in his estimate of the injuries sustained 
viz a bad bruise on the forehead and a 
VERY severe shaking we cannot however 
agree with his estimate of tho damages we 
think they are excessive for the actual 
damage sustained from these injuries for 
the pain and suffering undergone and the 
extra expense that the plaintiff has been 
PUT to 

subject to a PERPETUAL lease dated 
the WITH november 1874 now held by 
messrs smith mackenzie co at a 
rental of 310 per annum 

the above property VILL be sold by 
auction in the custumary way in
