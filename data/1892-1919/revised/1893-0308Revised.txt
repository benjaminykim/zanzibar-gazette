i at once sent a message to the two chiefs to send 
food into the camp the following morning and that if 
it did not make its appearance i should have to come 
and take it from them as it was not a fitting time 
to stand on ceremony with these rascals who are a 
precisely similar lot to those inhabiting the bura 
mountains who were recently punished by the 
company for their treacherous behaviour an 
answer was sent bade to say that the food should be 
sent in the following morning after waiting till 
nearly OF oclock without seeing any signs of food 
coming in i despatched a party of OF men with 
rifles with orders to bring the two chiefs into camp 
i f attacked they were to lire on the people but only 
in self-defence my men effected the capture and 
SD brought in a third old VILLAIN who had tried to 
egg the people on to fight which he nearly 
succeeded in doing 

samboja and MAMBA were in a great fright 
and wished to make blood-brotherhood with me at 
once the third old man was INDOLENT and defiant 
so promptly put km in chains so as to give him 
time to cool down i explained to the two chiefs 
that I must have food but at the same time did 
not wish to obtain it by violence unless compelled 
to do so they replied that if i would make 
bloodbrotherhood with them plenty should he brought in 
wishing to give them every chance i consented 
and the ceremony was performed after which i 
allowed then to return to their villages 
as miinyinigi the third INDIVIDUAL was still 
breathing defiance i kept him in chains for the 
night in camp and threatened that if lie continued 
to hold the same tone I would take him away 
altogether and send him down to the coast

death of 

h h sayyid all bin said 

and proclamation of 

sayyid hamed bin TWAIN 

as 

sultan of zanzibar 

wo have to record with much regret the 
death of his highness sayyidali bin said 
who after a long and tedious illness passed 
away at A oclock on sunday evening last the 
TH inst at the palace in zanzibar this event 
was not unexpected as it had been known for 
months past that the late sultan had been in 
a precarious state of health though it was not 
easy to know the precise course of his illness 
as lie refused to receive the attentions of any 
european doctor and to the last made strong 
efforts to conceal how dangerously ill he 
really was though he had some few days ago 
anticipated a fatal ending at no distant date and 
apprised mr KENNELL rodd her MAJESTY 
diplomatic agent of his apprehensions 
during the last few weeks rumours of the 
sultans death had been in the bazaar 
and bad caused at times considerable 
excitement until THEIR falsity had been established 
in view of the possibility of disturbances 
occurring when the sultans death did take 
place the british authorities both at the 
consulate and in the navy had prepared for 
any emergency a signalman had been on 
duty for the past three weeks at the agency 
lauding parties had been arranged and 
REGULI EARLY drilled on board h m s philomel 
while the night guard of ASKARIS had been 
I strengthened especially in districts where 
i trouble was likely to ensue and only last 
day general hatch in the presence of sir 
keimell rodd had shown the really 
danger pus element at MLINDI bow quickly the 
troops could be formed in their square if any 
disturbances arose in that quarter 
the last month must have been an 
extremely anxious one for all responsible for the 
security of the town as fears were entertained 
in many quarters that the death of the sultan 
would he the signal for an outbreak of 
RIOTING if not worse throughout the town though 
these apprehensions were considerably 

lessened when it became evident that the british 
authorities had prepared for every emergency 
and had taken precautions against every risk 
the cause for such fears was to be found in the 
fact that in addition to the ordinary dangers 
attending a time of great and general 
excitement in a mixed and only partially civilized 
community like zanzibar there were no less 
than three claimants to the throne each of 
whom had a considerable number of armed 
adherents thus it was almost certain that the 
proclamation of a successor would lead to 
dissensions amongst the arabs and in such an 
event the latter would probably be inclined 
to resort to force on behalf of their 
partisans and in any caserevenge themselves even 
temporarily upon the authorities in view of 
the injuries inflicted upon their own personal 
interests by the adoption and enforcement of 
a european policy in which slave-raiding and 
slavery was being abolished and restrictions 
placed upon an unlimited appropriation of 
revenue by those arabs who happened to be 
in favour at the palace 
the news of sayyid ALIS death was received 
with considerable doubt in town for a few 
minutes in view of previous false rumours 
but its truth on this occasion was soon 
apparent to everyone within ten minutes of bis 
death having been signalled to h m s 
philomel a naval party numbering about 
160 men and armed with machine guns were 
landed at pm from that ship and hm 
BLANCHE under the charge of lieut a b 
g GRENFELL whilst a party of marines were 
landed at the consulate to form a guard for 
mr KENNELL rodd h m diplomatic agent 
who accompanied by captain campbell 
NOR naval officer proceeded with this escort 
towards the palace the BLUEJACKETS joined 
this party at the custom house and marched 
thence to the palace where they FOUND 
RAN MATHEWS first minister of the 
ment to whose coolness and presence of mind 
must be attributed the fact that the arabs in 
the vicinity of the palace had not already 
resorted to violence to force an entry 
PITTANCE was demanded and at first 
refused and it was reported that an 
armed force of arabs bad been seen 
APPROACHING the palace but bad turned back 
when they saw the naval force lauded 
on the BEHELD for a brief interval matters 
looked serious and the persian guard being 
in possession of a loaded machine gun and 
occupying one corner of the palace square 
appeared to be also an clement of dangerthough 
this was shortly removed by THEIR placing 
themselves under the orders of general 

MATHEWS the palace was at this time 
occupied by said bin KHALID who had 
taken forcible possession captain 
bell who bad been desired by mr rodd to 
take military charge of AFFAIRS then brought 
up a gun to the palace door to effect 
an entry by force if necessary but said 
bin KHALID thought it wisest not to prolong 
the opposition and opened the doors a 
search was then instituted and captain 
bell proceeded to the upper storey of the 
lace followed by mr rodd and a guard of 
marines the brigade being left in charge of 
the square under the command of lieut 
GRENFELL said bin KHALID was at once made 
prisoner and sent under a guard to his own 
house where he was kept a close prisoner 
the prompt action of the authorities in 
taking charge ef the palace prevented the 
TREASURE room broken into and robbed 
and in fact there does not appear to have been 
any looting either in the palace or about the 
town 
sayyid hamed bin TWAIN bin sultan bin 
emuum the sultan designate who had 
remained quietly in his own house 
unconscious of the honour in store for him 
was then sent for and a conference 
was held in the palace mr rodd h m 
DIPLOMATIC agent captain campbell senior 
naval officer general LLOYD MATHEWS 
captain LINDLEY of h m s blanche 
general hatch and several arabs 
being present marines posted at 
the door sayyid hamed bin TWAIN having 
accepted the proposals made to him by mr 
rodd be was declared sultan and the 
clamation publicly read at OF RBR from the 
steps of the palace the naval brigade 
presenting arms and the buglers 
SOUNDING royal salute the naval brigade was 
then divided into two parties one 
REMAINING shore for service and the other returning to 
their ships the party remaining on shore 
was relieved early on monday morning 
on the news becoming known in town 
there was a general closing and barring of 
houses and shops parties of native troops and 
military police with fixed bayonets 
patrolled the main streets giving orders for doors 
to be closed while at various points ABOUT the 
town and suburbs there was a well-timed 
display of native troops and military police also 
with fixed bayonets the news was received 
quietly and after the first excited hum of 
enquiring voices had died away the only sound 
to be heard was the loud from the 
late sultans harem where the nows had been 
conveyed to his wives varied at intervals bv 

o 

the gazette 

i BINGLE call from one nr other of I 
recently constructed guard houses AT 
MLINDI ngamhu c at all of which a strong 
force had been stationed the streets were 
patrolled during the night by ARMED police 
general hatch making personal visits to all 
the dangerous HINTS the task of 
maintaining order about the town was most capitally I 
carried out by general hatch who despite 
the fact that the ASKARIS had to he summoned 
to the various districts by bugle had guards 
placed within a very few minutes at even the 
most distant points 
the body of the late sultan after being 
examined by the consular surgeon dr f 
CHARLESWORTH and cause of death ascertained 
was interred under a date palm in the palace 
garden at I am 
on monday morning the town had a very 
deserted aspect all shops and native houses 
being closed with very few inhabitants about 
the streets a small crowd had gathered in 
front of the palace which had been guarded 
all night by the naval forces general 
hews and general hatch were both at the 
palace the former having spent the night 
there 
at about OF am mr PENNELL ODD 
accompanied by captain campbell general 
MATHEWS the consular and government 
staffs captain LINDLEY and several of the 
officers OHMS philomel and blanche 
proceeded to the palace where they were 
received at a TIARA by the recently proclaimed 
sultan most of the leading arabs also being 
present during this interviewtho flag of his 
highness was hoisted and saluted by the 
lish and french in harbour and 
by the zanzibar glasgow all 
of which were decorated with flags and 
bunting with the departure of mrrodd and 
his staff from the palace the public events of 
the day terminated hut the streets were 
continually patrolled and a strong force of native 
TROOPS kept on guard at the palace 

on tuesday morning a reconciliation was 
effected between sayid bin KHALID and the 
sultan the former being restored to his i 
TON of honour in the court and granted 
presents by the sultan the only dissentient 
remaining now is the third aspirant to the 
throne SAYYID HAMOUS who is also a cousin 
of the late sultan he is an older man than 
sayyid HAIRED bin TWAIN and bad hopes of 
being made sultan up to the present sayyid 
tliunoud has not presented himself at the 
court of the new sultan though it is very 
unlikely that he will take any active steps in 
opposition to his rule 
in the course of yesterday morning the 
sultan received visits from the 
representatives of the several foreign powers who 
were introduced to him by mr PENNELL 
POND salutes were fired from the 
war as the respective consuls left the palace 
congratulations are general with regard 
to the admirable way in which the 
anticipated dangers attending the important 
change which has just taken place had 
been obviated and the complete absence of 
rioting or lawlessness in any form proved 
how perfect had been the arrangements a 
brief delay in taking charge of the palace or 
a want of organization in the naval military 
or police arrangements would have inevitably 
resulted in confusion and dangerthe elements 

of which were by no means absent as bad the 
claimants to the throne met with their armed 
adherents bloodshed would have 
inevitably resulted were it not for the 
TEMPERATE cxtonclod by OTV IVOR 
this island and for the security which 
has been established by those 
responsible for affairs we should in all probability at 
the present moment find trade paralysed and 
the town a scene of riot and confusion while 
the aspirants to the throne were engaged in 
settling their claims by force 
the reign which has just closed has seen 
many and great changes in the territorial 
possessions of the sultanate of zanzibar at the 
commencement of sayyid ahs reign these 
comprised not only the islands of zanzibar 
and PEMBA hut the whole coastline from 
GAU to BEADER a portion of this was 
leased at an annual rental to the imperial 
british east africa co but the remainder 
was under the direct control of the sultan of 
zanzibar difficulties assailed sayyid ALI 
however at the very outset as promises had 
been given by his predecessor which entitled 
GOWANY to a claim over the GAU coast and 
the territory behind these were at first 
resisted by the sultan but afterwards agreed 
to a sum of 200000 being paid as purchase 
money for this territory at this juncture 
sayyid ALI applied to england for protection 
which was granted and his seat upon the 
throne which was not particularly secure at 
that time was assured to him the relief 
which this protection afforded to sayyid ALI 
was however only temporary as he found 
that it necessitated the abolishment of abuses 
dear to the arab nature he was called upon 
to use his influence in repressing the slave 
trade and had consequently to issue edicts 
which provoked the enmity of his leading 
arab subjects whatever his own ideas may 
have been with regard to the advantages of 
european civilisation the policy he had to 
i pursue as the cost of seeming the jroteetioii 
of a european power was highly distasteful 
to his fellow countrymen who did not conceal 
from their sultan their opposition to his edicts 
and appeared at times regardless of the 
rashness and uselessness of such a proceeding to 
have blamed the sultan for not openly resisting 
the progress of european civilisation in his 
dominions whenever it clashed with their 
personal interests the close of sayyid ALIS 
brief reign can therefore have been scarcely 
happier for his own personal comfort than 
its commencement as step after step was 
taken to protect not the interests of the 
sultan and the chief arabs personally as 
they might have anticipated at first but the 
interests of zanzibar and its people sayyid 
ALI must have found himself in a most 
TRYING position on the one hand he had to 
assist in carrying out a policy which could 
pay little heed to arab ideas and on the other 
band be bad to meet daily in bis court the 
leading arabs whose interests were being 
affected by this policy and endeavour to 

TH march 189 
stem the wave of enmity which each fresh 
step raised amongst these subjects 

without question zanzibar is better in 
every way at the close of sayyid ALIS reign 
compared with its state when he ascended the 
throne but it has been improved of necessity 
according to european ideas and not to the 
immediate personal advantage either of its 
arab sovereign nor his arab subjects 

sayyid ALI bin said bin sultan bin IMAUM 
at the time of his death was only OF years 
of age he had been in weak health for the 
past two years his death resulting primarily 
from general debility though the immediate 
cause of death appears to have been a form of 
dropsy resulting from a complication of 
diseases of the liver and heart he was a well 
built man of pleasing appearance and affable 
manners and we have no doubt that those 
who have known him best and appreciated the 
difficulties of his position will have felt deep 
sympathy with him in the long illness which 
closed in his death last sunday evening 

the new sultan is about OF years of age 
and in the enjoyment of excellent health 
he has only one wife a daughter of sayyid 
BURGASH to whom he is greatly 
devoted his claim by descent to the throne was 
a very strong one while his personal character 
and ideas rendered him acceptable to the 
british authorities it is to be hoped that 
guided by the advice of the protecting 
er zanzibar will increase in influence and 
prosperity during the reign of h h sayyid 
hamed bin TWAIN of which there seems at 
present every hopeful augury his public 
declarations have been extremely satisfactory 
he has declared to his arab subjects that he 
thoroughly understands his position and will 
do all in his power to maintain it and that 
he is thoroughly at one with the protecting 
power he has at once set to work to reform 
abuses and has shown every promise of being 
a strong and capable ruler 

the general effect of the events which have 
just occurred has been to show the arabs the i 
real meaning of a protectorate which up to 
the present they had failed to understand 
now that any doubts on tins point have been 
cleared up it seems very improbable that h 
h sayyid hamed bin TWAIN will have to 
encounter the opposition and unpleasantness 
which was shown to his predecessor by many 
of his subjects as the benefits of the 
LECTORATE become more and more manifest as 
they are becoming day by day there is little 
doubt but that the arabs will see that 
whatever is to the benefit of zanzibar generally is 
alike beneficent to themselves and the 
friction which naturally attended the suppression 
of slave-trading having passed away will join 
heartily in assisting the protecting power in 
its work of progress

LASA prove itself a solid and lasting benefit to this 
EMPTY and its people and redound to the credit 
of the promoters of so practical and philanthropic 
an enterprise the report about the SCARCITY of 
food here is only too true since the rain has 
fallen the natives have been busy in their 
plantations but it will be some time even under the 
most favourable conditions before the crops will be 
ready for harvest 
I must now bring this letter to a close as time 
is short anil we start on our way once more 
tomorrow for macliakos in ulu where i will 
endeavour to send you further news of our doings and i 
hope u more cheerful account of things generally 
truly the clouds have hitherto been very dark and 
gloomy but I look forward hopefully for the silver 
lining

j reopen this report to add that the mail men not 
having come into KIBWEZI as expected t brought 
my letters along with me i arrived at the first 
camp about an hours march from this yesterday 
and then learnt that the COMPANY agent at 
SHAKOS HIS BEEN lighting with ho ava-kamba 
at xvilungu immediately ahead of us about their 
refusal to supply food to passing caravans he 
had written a general letter which was brought me 
by an old chief at NANI who has charge of it to 
say that everything was now settled and things 
were on a satisfactory footing once more 
ever shortly after leaving camp this morning i 
met the mail men on the road and they tell me 
that the people who were actually fought with have 
not made peace and wanted to attack them on the 
way LIES made a ORIGIN inarch and escaped OUT 
of their clutches it appears that only the people 
living close to the station who were not fought 
with have made peace with the COMPANY agent 
i have had in consequence to PUTELI camp again 
ill order to get the food which t hoped to procure 
on my arrival at kilnngu but this is now 
out of the question and wo may have to do some 
fighting the road from here lies up 
the bed of the river TIOU which is now some six or 
eight inches deep in water with high banks on each 
side the walking is had as the bed of the river 
is full of quicksands so if the natives are inclined 
to he hostile they have distinctly the advantage of 
the position as a laden caravan can travel hut 
slowly under such circumstances i therefore am 
not looking forward to with any great 
degree of pleasure they may perhaps decline to 
interfere with us when they sec the RISES provided 
that the men keep well together stragglers will 
have a very poor time of it it is fortunate I met 
the mail men when i did otherwise on the strength 
of what the letter at NGAI contained I should have 
walked gaily into it all and might have had most 
serious trouble as it is I am now PREPARED for 
whatever may happen but all this kind of thing 
is most troublesome and annoying AS it has delayed 
me for another day the saying it never rains 
hut it pours have come true enough in my case 
i wish the company would wake up and arrange 
matters properly once and for all along the 
whole route instead of dealing with them in this 
desultory fashion the times

death of 

h h sayyid all bin said 

and proclamation oe 

sayyid hamed bin TWAIN 

as 

sultan oe zanzibar 

we have to record with much regret the 
death of his highness sayyid ALI hin said 
who after a long and tedious illness passed 
away at A oclock on sunday evening last the 
TH inst at the palace in zanzibar this event 
was not unexpected as it had been known for 
months past that the late sultan had been in 
a precarious state of health though it was not 
easy to know the precise course of his illness 
as he refused to receive the attentions of any 
european doctor and to the last made strong 
efforts to conceal how dangerously ill ho 
really was though he had some few days ago 
anticipated a fatal ending at no distant date and 
apprised mr KENNELL rodd her MAJESTY 
diplomatic agent of his apprehensions 
during the last few weeks rumours of the 
sultans DEATH had BEEN current in the bazaar 
and had caused at times considerable 
excitement until their falsity had been established 
in view of the possibility of disturbances oc 
curling when the sultans death did take 
place the british authorities both at the 
consulate and in the navy had prepared for 
any emergency a signalman had been on 
duty for the past three weeks at the agency 
landing parties had BEEN arranged and 
regularly drilled on hoard h m s philomel 
while the night guard of ASKARIS had been 
strengthened especially in districts where 
trouble was likely to ensue and only last 
day general hatch in the presence of mr 
KENNELL rodd had shown the really danger 
ous element at MLINDI how quickly the 
troops could be formed in their square if any 
disturbances arose in that quarter 
the last month must have BEEN an 
extremely anxious one for all responsible for the 
security of the town as fears were entertained 
in many quarters that the death of the sultan 
would he the signal for an outbreak of 
rioting if not worse throughout the town though 
these apprehensions were considerably 

LESSENED when it became evident that the british I MATHEWS the palace 
i authorities had prepared for every emergency occupied by said bin 
i and had taken precautions against every risk 
the cause for such fears was to he found in the 
fact that in addition to the ordinary dangers 
attending a time of great and general excite 
ment in a mixed and only partially civilized 
community like zanzibar there were no loss 
than three claimants to the throne each of 
whom had a considerable number of armed 
adherents thus it was almost certain that the 
proclamation of a successor would load to 
dissensions amongst the arabs and in such an 
event the latter would probably ho inclined 
to resort to force on behalf of their 
partisans and ill any caserevenge themselves oven 
temporarily upon the authorities in view of 
the injuries inflicted upon their own personal 
interests by the adoption and enforcement of 
a european policy in which slave-raiding and 
shivery was being abolished and restrictions 
placed upon an unlimited appropriation of 
revenue by those arabs who happened to bo 
in favour at the palace 
the news of sayyid ALIS death was received 
with considerable doubt in town for a few 
minutes in view of previous false rumours 
but its truth on this occasion was soon 
apparent to everyone within ten minutes of his 
DEATH having been signalled to h m s 
philomel a naval party numbering about 
160 men and armed with machine guns were 
landed at PW from that ship and hm 
BLANCHE under the charge of lieut a b 
g GRENFELL whilst a party of marines were 
landed at the consulate to form a guard for 
mr RESMELL rodd h m diplomatic agent 
who accompanied by captain campbell 
NOR naval officer proceeded with this escort 
towards the palace the BLUEJACKETS joined 
this party at the custom house and marched 
thence to the palace where they found 
al MATHEWS first minister of the 
ment to whose coolness and presence of mind 
must be attributed the fact the arabs in 
the vicinity of the palace had not already 
resorted to violence to force an entry 
PITTANCE was demanded and at first 

fused and it was reported that 

ARMED force of arabs had BEEN seen 
approaching the palace hut had turned back 
when they saw the naval force being landed 
on the beach for a brief interval matters 
looked serious and the persian guard being 
in possession of a loaded machine gun and 
oecupyingone corner of the palace square 
appeared to be also an element of dangerthough 
this was shortly removed by their placing 
themselves under the orders of general 

was at this time 
KHALID who had 
taken forcible 
possession captain 
bell who had been desired by mr BODY to 
take military charge of affairs then brought 
up a gun to the palace door to effect 
an entry by force if necessary hut said 
bin KHALID thought it wisest not to prolong 
the opposition and opened the doors a 
search was then instituted and captain 
bell proceeded to the upper storey of the 
lace followed by mr rodd and a guard of 
marines the brigade being left in charge of 
the square under the command of lieut 
GRENFELL said bin KHALID was at once made 
prisoner and sent under a guard to his own 
house where he was kept a close prisoner 
the prompt action of the authorities in 
taking charge of the palace prevented the 
treasure room being broken into and rubbed 
aud in fact there does not appear to have been 
any looting either in the palace or about the 
town 
n sayyid hamed bin TWAIN bin sultan bin 
IMAUM the sultan designate who had 
remained quietly IU his IN house 
unconscious of the honour in store for him

steps of the palace the naval brigade

was relieved early on monday morning 
on the news becoming known in town 
there was a general closing and barring of 
houses and shops parties of native troops and 
military police with fixed bayonets 
patrolled the main streets giving orders for doors 
to he closed while at various points about the 
town and suburbs there was a well-timed 
display of native troops and military police also 
with fixed bayonets the news was received 
quietly and after the first excited hum of 
enquiring voices had died away the only sound 
to be heard was the loud wailing the

conveyed to his wives varied at intervals by
