mr cracknall left for LAMP in the BARNA

court there as chief judge of the imperial 
british last africa company there are 
one or two eases for trial the one of greatest 
importance being the murder of a banyan at 
GAZA a few months ago the banyan was 
LOCAL dead one morning in his house which 
is 111 an isolated position and though suspicion 
pointed strongly to certain individuals it 
was impossible owing to the district an 
outlying one to collect sufficient evidence to 
justify their committal for trial earlier mr 
meleunan the district superintendent of the 
OBLA coy at LAMP however has succeeded 
m collecting enough evidence to justify to 
committal of seven men about a month AND 
jealousy is supposed to have been the motive 
of the crime mr f h A WILSON prose

the annual prize distribution to the successful 
pupils of the JUAN smith MARESSA took 
place on saturday last at the coopers ROYAL 
naval institute the place was decorated 
with many coloured flags and bunting most 
artistically arranged and the rich and varied 
coloured costumes of the indian boys added 
to the effect soon after i pm the chairman 
of the committee of the school mr HARDING 
arrived with mr and mrs Estell-cornish 
i and they were conducted to seats arranged 
l for them on a raised platform at one end of 
the spacious room after nearly all who had 
been in VOTED arrived the proceedings 
commenced with mr HARDING calling upon the 
hon secretary to read the report for the 
past year the secretary said that the 
school was founded in 1891 its object 
BENTO give the benefits of elementary education 
to young indian and native boys and that 
i the expectations of the rounders were fully 
i realized he then gave a succinct account 
jot the business transacted at the various 
i committee meetings held during the year 
commented on the increasing number of 
j students the state of finances and concluded 
by reading the report founded on the annual 
examination of the boys held by mr LASCARS 
at the REQUESTOR the committee and submitted 
TO th in that report mr LASCARS 
j had expressed his satisfaction at the 
PROFICHI splayed by the boys in most of the 
j SUBJECTS taught at the fact also that physical 
j culture was not altogether neglected and 
I horn-fugue bv commending that the 
hours of study m the school might with 
advantage be reduced after this some of the 
boys gave recitations a young BORAH lad 
opened the programme with a recitation in 
ARALAC from A koran the solemn words as 
TURM v deeply impressed the faithful 
HIS was followed by recitations in 
GUJERATI 
I WHICH were well executed to be IU turn 
followed by a few in english it 
I x A FFC was quite 
a surprise to hear the juveniles recite short 
passages in english with elearucss 
distinctness and due attention to accents SHOW 
that the examiners flattering comments on 
the proficiency of the hoys in english were 
not unmerited one boy recited the well 
known passage from the bard of AVON where 
the history of humanity IU its individual 
aspect is so vividly given in the seven parts 
we ARE said to fly on the stage of this world 
the seventh and last sans everything bein 
not a very tempting one to enter upon and 
which most of us thanks to the climate of 
zanzibar will be effectually prevented even 
from approaching 

march A 1895 
after the recitations the most interesting 
pert of the function was gone through viz the 
distribution of prizes which were given out 
by mrs cornish 
the first boy of the school FALL BANA 
besides receiving three prizes was the lucky 
recipient of a prize of bs OF from mr 
INGE after the prizes which consisted of books 
chiefly were distributed mr HARDING rose 
and requested the hon secretary to translate 
what he said for those who could not 
understand english 
ladies and gentlemen 

it gives me great pleasure to preside at a 
gathering like this as i take a keen interest 
in the progress and WELFARE of this 
TON the way in which the boys have gone 
through their english recitations shows 
what progress they have made and as 
lish must be to them like a dead language they 
SHOULD justly feel as proud of their efforts as 
i should have if at their age i had succeeded 
in reciting passages as well from latin or 
greek 

i quite agree with what is stated in the 
report as to the necessity of active 
COOPERATION on part of the parents and i call upon 
the indian gentlemen here to do their ut 
most in every way to further the efforts of 
the founders of this institution 

the gazette 

games should be encouraged and it is IU 
great measure their love for these that has 
made the english people the manly and 
robust race they are with these words 
calling again on the parent of the boys for 
steady with the school 
authorities aud thanking mrs cornish for so kindly 
consenting to distribute the prizes mr 
INGE resumedhisseat amid cheers mr LASER 
proposed a vote of thanks in the name of the 
committee to mr HARDING for the keen 
and practical interest he has shown in the 
WELFARE of the school to which mr HARDING 
having suitably replied the gathering broke 
up shortly before g pm 

the bombay and persia steam navigation 
company s s nadcri from calcutta with a 
cargo of rice and few passen gers arrived here 
on the TH instant 

the concert in aid of the famine fund 
which took place last saturday was a great 
success the room was crowded and many 
had to remain standing great praise is due to 
all who took part in the evenings proceedings

she was in the mediterranean fleet but 
received orders to temporarily join the east 
squadron in place of h m s redbreast 
and pigeon which have left for china 

of the boys here many will be hereafter 
merchants or members of the learned 
profession or will enter the government service 
which the indian government has thrown 
open to the deserving and aspiring youth of 
that country and whatever their walk in life 
they will find that a sound knowledge of 
the subjects taught in this school i e 
english GUJERATI arithmetic geography 
and history will be of great use to them 
the parents of some of these boys will say 
we can understand the usefulness of the 
other subjects but what is the use of HISTORY 
of what use is it to a hoy in after life to know 
which king reigned 500 years ago or which 
general defeated which 300 years ago a 
knowledge of these events will not enable him 
their highness the duke aud duchess 
to determine the probable value of cloves in

markethere who are on a tour are now in ceylon and it 
ry and that history of india opens up a wide is more than probably they will visit the 
field for the hoys it teaches them the man territories in east africa 
history of a civilization which flourished 
when most of the modem civilizations were 
yet unborn it fires the imagination of the 
hoys with a spirit of emulation when 
THREAD in its pages the deeds of the CHIVALRY 
of RAJPUTANA which vied with those of the 
chivalry of middle ages it tells them of 
the doings of kings like AKBAR and 
ZEEBA and in latter days of statesmen like 
sir salar jung and maharaja SCANDIA of 
GWALIOR it makes them feel proud of their 
country and of the men their COUNTRY 
produced and for these reasons i welcome 
the introduction of the study of indian 
history in this school

the ancient romans talked of a sound

what is stated in the report as to the value 
of attention paid in the school to physical 
culture when i am walking or riding out

probate and ADMINISTRATION 

cause no A of 1895 

in the estate of CANDI RAMPART deceased 
this was au application for probate of a paper 
purporting to be the will of the late khoja 
CANDI RAMPART it was made before his 
honour judge de sausmarez on february 
WORD when judgment was reserved 
mr LASCARS appeared for the applicant 
there was no opposition the facts appear 
sufficiently in the judgment 
judgment 

this is a case in which probate has been 
asked of a paper which purports to be the 
last will of khoja CANDI RAMPART the paper in 
question was written by a friend of the 
deceased from a rough draft in the DECEASED 
hand writing this draft had been carefully 
considered by the deceased aud it seems 
undoubtedly to have represented his 
testamentary intentions and had he lived a short time 
longer it would have been executed the 
paper has also been sworn to be an accurate 
copy of the draft the only sou of the 
deceased who had no other child propounded 
this will there was no opposition this 
being a question of revenue as 
administration duty is higher than probate 

the law governing matters of this nature 
has to be considered by the order in council 
of 1884 the indian succession act is in force 
hero but the 331st section thereof excludes 
the property of any hindu mahomedau or 
BUDDHIST from its operation the khojas 
being subject to hindu law in matters of 
succession are consequently not under the 
operation of the act many provisions of the 
act are inforced in indian under the hindu 
wills act and the probateand administration 
act has made many provisions in respect of 
wills and the property of person dying testate 
or intestate but these acts are not in force 
here i have then to consider whether english 
law is to govern this will aud i must conclude 
that it does not the property of HINDOOS 
and MAHOMETANS has always been distributed 
in zanzibar according to the particular 
practice of hindu aud MAHOMMEDAN law and 
english law which has been laid down by 
the order in council as that to be followed 
save when elsewhere provided has never been 
applied by this court in such a case and i 
thinkrightly the next question is whether 
there is a difference between moveable and 
immoveable property in view of article 
xvi of the treaty which grants 
exterritoriality i think the lex ret SITE must be ousted in 
the case of real property and the law 
administered by the courts here substituted that 
law is the law administered in india 
is the domicil of origin of most british 
subjects here it will in this case be the same 
for real and personal property however as 
i have pointed out certain indian enactments 

A 

are not in force here though i think it 
would be a good thing that they should be 
i must therefore conclude to adopt the law 
which was applicable in the mofussil before 
the hindoo wills act and here there are 
several cases to help me notably terachund 
bose vs NOBLEST chunder hitter reported A 
w it WAS and VINAYA SAROYAN jog vs 
govindrnv CHINAMAN jog A bombay a c 
114 i have however only seen the digest 
ROOPIT of these cases taking the cases as a 
whole this appears to be a valid will and 
entitled to probate which must be granted

despatched with a second powerful army and added 
that in case of necessity he himself would march

king HUMBERT has sent another message of 
congratulation to general baratieri his majesty 
declares that the victories at COATI and SENATE 
constitute a fresh triumph of civilization over 
barbarism he warmly thanks all the officers and 
men for their gallantry and devotion to DUTY 
in his flight from SENATE ras margascia left in 
his camp a number of ensigns and a quantity of 
war material this is regarded as a proof that 
many influential chiefs were with him in the tent 
of has mangascia some important letters were 
discovered and around it were a number of corpses 
as he fled southwards ras mangascia passed 
adigrat and on the same day the native chiefs 
and warriors of the district came to the italian

is SATIN bey returning from

the report from vienna that SATIN bey has 
escaped from the mahdi is a reminder of the fact 
that here are still a number of europeans in 
captivity in omdurman according to the rumour the 
general of DARFUR is making for 
la i PREVIOUS fugitives father ohrwalder and others 
have escaped to egypt and perhaps it was a good 
plan now to alter the route but how SATIN is to 
get into KASSALA when it is almost surrounded by the 
SOUDANESE forces it is not easy to understand the 
bringing away of captives from the mahdi via wady 
haifa has-cost at least 200 in each case some of 
the expense HAS been borne by the egyptian 
FENCE department and if it should turn out that 
the italians have contributed to the sum necessary

madagascar was perhaps better known to our 
GRANDFATHERS than it is to us this may seem a 
strange thing to say but the old 
merchant-adventurers who went round the cape of good hope had 
a keener eye for black ivory for the west indies 
than even for the pearls of the east indies when 
john company attained a political not to say an 
imperial status he had no time to dally about this 
great island off the african coast and so it 
dropped gradually out of the LOGBOOKS and out of sight 
v lien it reappeared before the present 
generation the island ranked almost as a few discovery 
and even few people in this country know 
AS much about it as do the TRENCHAND that is 
not a great deal at the present moment 
NASCAR represents two things to the average briton 
a possible casus belli with france and a probable 
addition to the french colonial empire and yet 
if we are to believe captain DAWSON who certainly 
is no mean authority on the subject and who has 
just been giving a london audience the fruits of 
his experiences and the sum convictions this 
african island which yet is not of africa is 
destined to occupy an important place in the future of 
the eastern world the climate is generally 
believe to be UNHEALTHY and certainly it is not 
favourable to occupation by european troops in certain 
seasons of the year as the french know but we are 
getting wiser now than in the days of the indian 
griffin and we have learned that the healthiness 
or otherwise of climate is very much a matter of 
conduct captain DAMSONS contention after long 
residence in the island is that madagascar is 
capable by reason of its soil climate and formation 
of yielding in profusion and in perfection all the 
richest and moat valuable products of the 
temperate and torrid zones that there are unlimited 
marketsopen for itsprodueeatgood prices apartfrom 
domestic consumption and that it only needs 
TISH capital and british energy to reap one of the 
richest harvests in this last virgin country of the 
world 
this looks a large order and aggravatingly so at 
a time when madagascar seems about to drop into 
the maw of france but theres many a slip twixt 
the cup and the lip and the HOVAS are not yet 
conquered MUFI less annexed as the third largest 

march A 1895 
island in the world after borneo and new guinea 
madagascar has plenty of bulk though more length 
than thickness et within its area of less than a 
quarter of a million of square miles intersected by a 
range of mountains rising to a height of 006 feet 
there is some of the most interesting and productive 
country in the world it is really a terra incognita 
because there are no roads and produce has to be 
carried to the const much as it is from uganda to 
bassaand just because there ARE no roads labour 
though cheap is most expensive unlike the 
RITUS madagascar is not the chosen home of 
hurricanes and that is a great thing because madagascar 
appears to be destined to outshine mauritius as a 
great sugar-producing island sugar of course is 
dirt cheap nowadays but so are most commodities 
and anew held of sugar production has interest for 
all the civilised racesespecially as fiji of which so 
much was hoped HAS turned out rather a 
disappointing place madagascar moreover is some 
thousands of miles nearer to us than fiji is and in the 
matter of practical commerce distance does not lend 
enchantment to the view it is not captain 
son alone who asserts it but a large body of expert 
opinion declares that the commercial future of 
dagascar rests on sugarthat there is no part of 
the world in which sugar can be so well and so 
cheaply produced as in that island says one reporter 
with the introduction of good machinery and 
sufficient capital madagascar could supply the whole 
world with sugar and at enormous advantage to 
herself financially british capital and energy has 
been the pioneer to this industry and not sugar 
alone all the soil is virgin all kinds of tropical 
vegetation grow in abundance and the higher lauds 
are suitable for wheat and other temperate produce 
so we are assured the variety of climate and of 
product form the rich endowment which the island 
enjoys from bountiful nature says captain 
SOUTHERN are in all parts extensive virgin forests 
abounding in valuable treesamong these are ebony 
mahogany rosewood cedar sandalwood copal and 
many other kinds the immense virgin forests are 
very imperfectly known but what portions have 
been recently exploited have been found to have 
varied kinds of valuable woods suitable for cabinet 
work and building purposes wheat is grown 
at an elevation of 4000 feet and rice along the 
low grounds but coffee it seems can be grown 
of the choicest quality tobacco grows wild and 
cotton of long fine silky staple is already 
finding its way to madagascar in fact to judge 
from the list it would be hard to say what can 
not be grown to advantage in madagascar but 
nevertheless among the rural population 
cattleraising is THE principal industry of the western 
portions of the island one wonders whether this 
is a survival from the days of THE EASI india 
company when the victualling station of st 
helena was supplied by the natives of 
land and when vessels rounding the cape would 
be in need of fresh meat before stretching across the 
indian ocean however this may be a trade in 
frozen meat between the african island and 
field is already suggested as a possibility gold 
too is reported to exist andgokl has also been 
exported hut whether it is destined to add to the fortunes 
of the island is a problem of the future in the 
meantime it seems to add only to its misfortunes 
if we may judge from the disputes about concessions 
and the like and the eagerness which the prospect 
of gold-finding has infused into the french attack 
after a faithful perusal of all the glowing reports 
on TRY resources of madagascar one is constrained to 
admit that there is something in it madagascar 
is certainly beautiful and may one day be rich 
but it needs roads and railways and capital both 
lor them and for the development of natural 
resources will that capital be furnished by briton 
will they select madagascar as a place of settlement 
while france is endeavouring to have things all 
her own way and supposing that france should 

the gazette 

attain her presumed though not her avowed end 
will she provide the wherewithal or will madagascar 
become a second algiers the outlook is full of 
interest in many ways and especially in so far as 
ILIO character of the HOVAS enters into it it is 
said that they will never consent to rest under the 
protection of france and that they will fight for 
their national independence so long as they can 
muster a troop it is certain at any rate that the 
BRANCH army will have no easy WALKOVER and 
that the losses on both sides will be heavy can 
the horror of such a conflict not be averted by a 
separation of the commercial from the political 
elements of the dispute it seems deplorable that 
political ambitions should make shipwreck of a 
country of such rich commercial potentiality and 
yet it is odd that during all the centuries through 
which the scramble for africa and the race for 
india have PRECEDED the european nations have 
hurried past this treasure island as if it were a 
place of no account or of evil fate the GLASGOW

there is still work to be done in the exploration 
of central africa and a strong interest attaches 
to the instalments of that work which from time 
to time reach us from the labours of intrepid men 
who commit themselves fo the task count von 
GOTTEN a german explorer has succeeded in 
passing through central africa from cast to west 
choosing a route not far apart from that of mr 
stanley when he went in search of EMIN pacha 
only the reverse way count von GOTTEN passed 
through the dense forest region lying north of the 
congo which mr stanley describes so graphically 
but the most valuable portion of his work was given 
to the exploration of the mountain ranges lying to 
the west of the southern end of the victoria 
NA these mountains have been seen and partially 
explored from various directions with the result 
that the several observers describe them from the 
appearance they presented to them and it has been 
rather difficult for geographers to reconcile the 
accounts and form a correct map of the region 
there is reason to believe that count von DOZENS 
researches will enable that to he done the 
MIRO mountains were found by the count to 
consist of five distinct peaks tlc most westerly of 
which is an active volcano which he estimates to 
be 11220 feet in height for three days he cut 
his way through the forests that clothe its sides 
and ascended to the top he found the crater 
walls 1000 feet high and enclosing a space about 
a mile in diameter with two shafts protruding 
from the floor from one of which steam issued 
count von GOTTEN has examined the river and lake 
system connected with these mountains and his 
discoveries promise to add a great deal to the 
geography of an interesting region of africa which 
will long remain difficult of access though nothing 
worse than forests and morass appears to block 
the way newcastle daily journal

we should be the last to wish to make light of the 
fact remains that he has not succeeded in increasing 
to any appreciable extent the financial resources of 
the colony of french congo and this will no 
doubt help to explain the coldness with which the 
news of his HOMECOMING is received by the french 
press the enormous tract of country known as 
french congo is considerably larger in extent than 
france and a substantial portion of it has been in 
the hands of the french for upwards of forty years

way of being thrown aside for the more youthful
