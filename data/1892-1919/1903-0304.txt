Mr. Chamberlain speaking at a Banquet 
on Tuesday evening at Cape Town made 
an optimistic speech on the situation in

the Balkan states that the}' cannot count 
on further assistance if they attempt forcibly

LOCAL NEWS. 

Ox Thursday last the members of the 
Ismaili Jamat held an “At Home” at their 
prettily situated Club on the North Road, 
the object being to welcome Sir John Kirk 
hack to Zanzibar. As is generally known, 
Sir John Kirk was formerly Consul-General 
here and during his long administration 
made many and warm friends among the 
Indian Communities resident in Zanzibar. 
It was therefore with great pleasure that 
those who had benefited by his former kind- 
ly services took advantage of the opportunity 
afforded by his temporary presence here, to 
hid him w elcome and wish him a pleasant 
return voyage to England. The weather 
was fine, and the pretty grounds of the 
Punjebhai Club were looking their best 
when the guests began to arrive at 4-15. 
General Eaikes, Acting Regent and First 
Minister of the Zanzibar Government and all 
the principal English Residents were present 
and also many of the leading Arabs. Sir 
John Kirk arrived with the Acting Ao-ent 
and Consul-General and Mrs. Cave at 4-43 
and after being welcomed by Mr. Remtulla 
Hemani on behalf of the Jamat, was con- 
ducted by him a-id tho Mtikhi Visram 
Rahimani, and the Camrin, Bhalloo Villi 
to the central assembly hall, where all the 
guests and some hundreds of the members 
of the Jamat worn assembled Mr. R Me 
Clure Byron on behalf of the heads' and 
members of the Ismaili Jamat thereupon in 
a short speech conveyed to Sir John Kirk, 
tho great pleasure it gave them all to see 
him amongst them once again. After 
touching briefly on the high' esteem 'in 
whichhir John Kirk had always been field 
by the British Indian subjects in Zanzibar 
Mr. Byron formally welcomed him to tho 
Pn.ijebhai Citib, and expressed the hope 
•tlifttrihis .passage homo would be pleasant 
and his future happy. Sir John Kirk in a 
few well chosen words thanked tho Jamat 
for the very kindly welcome extended to 
him that day. life refered to tho unmy and 
great changes for the better which he had 
observed in Zanzibar since he had last been 
there,.-and hoped that the improvemeur

Mr. Chamberlain sailed for England on 
Wednesday and received an enihusiastic 
farewell. 
M- Dclcasse has requested the Foreign 
Affairs Committee to suspend the consi- 
deration of the Siamese Treaty, the Gover- 
nor of ludo-China having prepared a scheme 
which will require previous negotiations 
with Siam. This statement is interpreted 
to mean that M. Delcasse is abandoning the 
ratification of the Treaty in favour of a new 
one prepared by the Governor who is 
known to support the Colonial groups views. 
It is however, semi officially stated in 
Paris that M. Dcdcfasse is differing the rati- 
fication of the Siamese Convention because 
Siam has shown no evidence of a desire to 
settle the economic questions according to 
the spirit of the convention.

LAND BOOM IN UGANDA. 

GREAT SALE AT KAMPALA. 

Large Prices Realised. 

DIVE TIMES THE Dl’SET AMOUNT FETCHED. 

(From our Entebbe Correspondent.) 

On Tuesday, February 3rd, the auction of 
the new town plot leases took place at 
Kampala, when some exceedingly high 
figures were reached. There were 22 diffe- 
rent lots sold, the upset price of each 
being Rs. 75. At whatever price the plot 
is knocked down, that sum is the ground 
rent payable to Government yearly for a 
term of 49 years, after which the Govern- 
ment have the option of taking over the 
plot, and compensating for all substantial 
buildings then on the land. 
The auction commenced punctually at 
10 a.m., and it was soon obvious that no 
plots were going to he knocked down for the 
upset price, and that some keen bidding 
would take place for the plots facing the 
Market. 
Rs. 150, Rs. 300, and Rs. 350,. were soon 
reached, and the bids still kept rising until 
Rs. 400 was reached and passed, the highest 
figure being finally reached at Plot No. 1 
of Block C which fetched Rs. 435. No less 
than six plots fetched over Rs. 400 each, 
and altogether the sale was the largest and 
most successful over held in the Protecto- 
rate. 
To people who know Kampala it may be 
of interest to hear that the New Town site is 
immediately on the right of the main road 
from Kampala Hill and Nakersero Hill, on 
the east side of the river, and to the right 
of the Mahommedan chief, M’Boga’s sham- 
ha, continuing along the ridge of the same 
hill.”

000. It was impossible to find any ques- 
tion dividing them. 
Mr. Brodrick in reply to Mr. Hobbouse 
said that large operations in Somaliland 
were not contemplated. There was never 
the smallest intention of going further 
than checking the advance of the Mullah

sufficient.

latterly been on indifferent terms with 
the Emperor Menelik, is quitting Abyssinia 
and will not return. 
Mr. Brodrick announced in the House of 
Commons that a Royal Commission had 
been appointed to enquire into the condi- 
tion of the volunteer forces. 
Mr. Balfour moved that the growino- 
needs of the Empire require the establish^ 
ment of a permanent Defence Committee 
formed of the members mentioned on the 
15th February. The results of their wort- 
will be handed from Government to Gov- 

ernment securing a continuity of policy 
which hitherto they had not possessed. 
The motion was received with enthusiasm 
and adopted.

It is understood that the preliminary ex- 
penditure on Queensferry as a Naval base 
will ,-£2,500,000 including an arsenal and 
fortifications ami large stores for war mate- 
rial. This step has created a disagreable 
impression in Germany, whore it is regarded 
as a countermove to German Naval activity. 
The Railway Conference at Johannesburg 
presided over by Lord Milner, approved the 
construction of an alternative line from 
Natal to Johannesburg via the Wilgeriver. 
The French Chamber has voted the 
Budget by 471 to 82 votes.
