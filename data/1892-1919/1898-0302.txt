The student of the growth and develop- 
ment of languages might do worse than pay 
a visit to British Central Africa, where, 
according to the testimony ofa wnterm 
the small news-sheet published at Zomba, 
an interesting addition is being made 
to the language of t^at part of .Afrjca. 
It mi"ht have been thought that Africa had 
enough forms of speech of its own, for not 
infrequently tribes separated by a few miles 
of country do not understand each other s 
language, but it is perhaps for this very 
reason that the Sikh soldiers, who are now 
a permanent feature of British Central 
Africa life, have invented a new language 
which appears to have become the military 
language of the Protectorate. The basis of 
the new language is said to be Hindustani, 
hut that it is a somewhat jumbled mixture 
mav be gathered from this further list of 
ingredients-" Gumrakhi, broken SwahiU, 
broken Manganja, possibly a little Yao, and 
Sepov English.” Nearly all the non-com- 
missioned officers in the Protectorate forces 
are Sikhs, and it was, of course, necessary 
that they should communicate with tne 
natives who, apart from the couple of hun- 
dred Sikhs, form the bulk of the little army 
which the Commissioner has at his disposal. 
It was this necessity no doubt that produced 
the new lunguage, but its use appears to be 
gradually extending outside military circles. 
Among the military it has been adopted by 
others than the Sikhs in their intercourse 
with the natives. A Yao non-commissioned 
officer drilling his Makua recruits does so in 
this quaint compound, and it is even sug- 
gested that the European learned in Mangan- 
ja, as it taught in ortholox treatises, is 
sometimes glad to avail himself of the ser- 
vices of a Sikh soldier in making his mean- 
ing clear to a native. The Sikhs do not 
stav long in Africa. The term of service 
for'which they volunteer is, I believe, two 
vears; but the new draft who come from 
India to take the place of their brethren 
who are returning home appear to have no 
difficulty in picking up a working uquaintance 
with the language, and in course of time it 
is quite possible that this mongrel compound 
may take the place of some of the many 
dialects which are the despair of travellers 
und officials in Africa.

THE CRISIS IN THE 

UPPER NILE. 

The most critical situation in Africa at 
the present time is in the basin of the Upper 
Nile, where events are takingplace, compar- 
ed with which delimitation quarrels in 
West Africa and the retrocession of Kassala 
sink into insignificance. The recent advan- 
ce up the Nile from Egypt can have but one 
ultimate aim—the commercial reopening of 
the Soudan, which would inevitably nesult 
from the occupation of Khartoum. " The 
feelings of complaisant satisfaction with 
. which England has watched the advance of 
I the "Egyptian army towards “the gate of the 
Soudan,” have not been disturbed by a 
consciousness of the fact that another Power 
has quietly occupied the goal. Immediately 
after the British retreat from Khartoum in 
1885, the French began preparations for 
the annexation of the Bahr-el-Ghazl provin- 
ce and the left bank of the Upper Nile. In 
1687 they compelled the Congo Free State 
to agree to a fresh convention (that of 29 
April, 1887), whereby the French secured 
an easy route into the Nile basin from the 
French Congo. As soon us the Power of 
Muhdism began to wane, French agents 
crossed the low watershed that separated 
their province of the Mbomu from the 

Bahr-el-Ghazl, and they concluded treaties 
with the native chiefs. These proceedings 
were conducted secretly, and were not re- 
vealed until the escape of Slatin Pasha, who, 
during his imprisonment at Omdurman, 
had translated the treaties and Franch pro- 
clamations . Meanwhile the Belgians had 
attempted to annex the coveted Bahr-el- 
Ghazl for the Congo Free State ; Nilis, for 
example, had actually occupied and fortified 
the town of Katuuka. But on the Belgian 
advance being made known in Europe, 
France pointed out that it was contrary to 
the Convention of 29 dpril, 1887, and ins- 
isted on the return of all the Congo Free 
State forces to the south of the Mbomu. 
Finding from the Belgian success that Mah- 
dism was no longer powerful in Central 
Soudan, the French begun preparations for 
an advance to the Nile. Aluminium 
launches or “gun boats” were sent up the 
Congo to the Mbomu for transportations 
thence to the Bahr-el-Ghazl. M. Liotard,. 
the Governor of the Haut-Congo, crossed 
into the Nile basin, and reinforcements 
under M. Marchaud were hurried forward 
to his assistance. M. Lioturd was at Dom 
Zubeir at the end of Juno, while, when last 
heard of, M. Murchaud was at Dom Sulei- 
man, a few marches to the north-west. 
Dom Zubeir is an important post, about 
five degrees to the West of Nile. Continu- 
ing eastward, M. Liotard reached and oceu-- 
pied Meshera-er-Rek on 23 July, having in 
less than a month crossed three fifths of the 
belt that separated him from the Nile; and 
unless some accident has happened to him,, 
he, no doubt, reached the Nile in August or 
early iu September. 

On the Nile he was jirobably met by a 
French force which had reached the river 
from Abyssinia. The late Captain Clochet- 
te, to whose aid the Abyssinians were appa- 
•ently largely indebted for their victory at 
Adowa, left Addis-Aheba-, the present capi- 
tal of Abyssinia, curly in the spring. He 
was followed by a second force, under the 
Marquis de Bonchamp and M. Michel, who 
left the same town on the 17th May, and 
came up with Captain Clochette, at' Gore, 
on July 1st. The two parties rested there 
till the 22nd of July. On that day they 
resumed their j’ourney to the west, march- 
ing on parallel linos towards the Nile at 
Fashoda, 200 miles distant. Captain Clo- 
chette was shortly afterwards accidentally 
killed, hut he Marquis de Bonchamp ajipears 
to have reach Fashoda in September. There 
is no proof that he has actuallv effected a

junction with M. Liotard, but in all proba- 
bility it has already taken place. Geogra- 
phically, the country is well known, so 
that exploration plays no part in the work 
of any of these expeditions, which have 
been undertaken solely for the sake of poli- 
tical annexation. The leaders claim to 
have taken possession of the country in the 
name of either France or Abyssinia, and it 
is necessary to consider the value of this 
occupation. 
On the west bank of the Nile, the ques- 
tion depends on the relative value of the 
Egyptian claim based on former possession, 
and that of the French, maintained on _ the 
ground of present occupation. The British 
Government has repeatedly affirmed that 
the Bahr-el-Ghazl is still Egyptian, and 
therefore in the British sphere of influence. 
The French reply that there are no rights 
of sovereignty in Africa unless supported 
by occupation, and that the British retreat 
in 1885, and the declarations of 1889, leave 
thorn free to enter the country, and hold it 
if they can. 
On the east bank of the Nile the question 
largely hinges on the treaty signed last 
May by Menelik and Mi. Bennell Rodd. 
The terms of that agreement are still secret. 
The only rumours not based on manifest 
guessing are some that have reached Paris 
from the Abyssinian capital, and the fact 
that they reach us throngh French sources 
renders them untrustworthy; but the secret 
is more likely to be betrayed in Addis- 
Abeba than in London. According to these 
rumours, England agreed to recognise the 
Abyssinian possession of the whole of the 
territory on the right bank of the Nile from 
just south of Khartoum to the Albert 
Nyanza, and north of a line drawn thence 
eastward along the second parallel of north 
latitude to the Juba. The whole of this 
vast area is at any rate claimed by the 
Abyssinians, and the Negus has entrusted 
the administration of the southern part to 
the Franco-Russian association of Count 
Lcontieff. If this preposterous Abyssinian 
claim be admitted, then British East Africa 
is cut off from the north by a belt of coun- 
try, either French or under French admi- 
nistration, extending right across Africa 
from the Red Sea to the Atlantic. The 
possession of Uganda and Khartoum will 
bo useless, and the millions of money de- 
voted to the Nile campaign and the Uganda 
railway will have been spent in vain. And 
this British failure will be all the more 
mortifying from the painful contrast be- 
tween the secrecy and swiftness of the 
French movements and the blundering 
clumsiness with which the English com- 
petitor in the race for Fashoda has entered 
the field. In this case, alas ! the race is to 
the swift, and Major Macdonald is squon- 
•dering resources intended for the protection 
of British interests on the White Nile in

shores.—-Saturday Bevieir.   

THE CULTIVATION OF 
olives, i tun 
“ Ifc is certain that the greater part of the 
Mediterranean littoral was in ancient tunes, as 
it now is,- the hom * of the olive : and.of all t se 

countries which claim thfc • tree ns indigenous, 
Italy is that which is the chief cf the oil-produ- 
cing countries of the region. And in Italy it 
grows upon a great variety of soil, and in a fair 
variety of climate. It is found wild on the 
scorching and rocky hills near Taranto, where 
it grows from seeds which have probably been 
carried from place to place by birds, and casually 
deposited in some fissure, where sufficient soil 
has been found to nourish the young plant. 
For birds are extremely partial to olives : indeed, 
in the Southern provinces of Italy, -where the 
large migratory thrush, so heartily praised by 
Horace—on his journey to Brundusium—still 
abounds, we find the expense of gunpowder for 
bird-scaring a considerable item in the olive- 
growers’ accounts. The cultivated olive, too, is 
a tree which is very independent of soil, and may 
be seen growing on a rocky hillside or on the 
deep soil of the plains, and flourishing as well in 
the one situation as in the other. 
“The small province of Lucca has given its 
name to the finest table oil in the world, and 
though the best oils of Bari in tills district com- 
pare favourably with it, they have not the same 
celebrity. 
Of the South Italian oils those ol Bari have 
the greatest repute, and many of the trees 
are of great antiquity. The annual export 
of oil from Italy amounted in 1888 to 
63,500 tons. A very large proportion of this 
exports goes to the British Empire, and though 
no doubt the importers care little about the 
methods of the cultivation of the tree, as compared 
with the market price at which they can purchase 
the oil wholesale, the cultivation is an important 
item to British trade, because a determined effort 
is boing made to introduce the tree, both in South 
Africa and the Australian colonies. The plants 
are being sent out in considerable numbers from 
Naples, chiefly, if not solely, by. the firm of 
Messrs. Dammann, of Portici. a suburb of Naples, 
who have also charged themselves with the 
introduction of the Karob into Soutn Africa. 
“ It is unnecessary to mention the variety of 
uses to which olive oil is put, but it may be inter- 
esting to note that large quantities are used on 
sheep-runs in the colonies for sharpening the 
clippers at shearing time. Time alone can show 
what success the introduction of the tree will 
have in our colonies. It may be that the best 
oil will be produced ; it may also be that only 
the lower class oils, such as those grown in 
Turkey, which are only useful for making soap, 
will be manufactured, but at any rate a useful 
lubricant will be obtained and a very picturesque 
tree added to the landscape. In the meantime a 
report in English on the cultivation of the plant 
cannot fail to be of service. The wild olive or 
oleaster is a tree of small and stunted growth, 
and yields a fruit from which very little oil can 
be procured. The grafting of the oleaster was 
known in very ancient times, and is mentioned 
by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans who, 
however, for the reasons of his metaphor, or 
perhaps from ignorance of arboriculture, reverses 
the process and describes the oleaster as being 
grafted on the olive, whereas, of course, it is the 
cultivated tree which is grafted on the stem of 
the wild one. The oleaster can be raised from 
seeds in the ordinary way, or it can be raised 
from the fungoids which olives hear underground 
at the point where the roots separate themselves 
from the trunk. Olive trees live to a very great 
age, and their wood is very useful for cabinet- 
making, as it is hard as well as pliaple, and can 
be easily manipulated. The smaller boughs 
form an excellent fuel, for owing to the oil in 
them, they burn like a torch, and as the trunks 
of old trees are apt to become hollow, many of 
them are only fit for the -same purpose. The 
a-je is evergreen, and the leaves fall after about 

throe years, being, of course, constantly replaced 
in the course of nature by younger ones. The 
olive commences to flower at the base of its 
foliage, the flowers gradually extending upwards, 
The best crops are always obtained when the 
trees flower early, and this occurs (when the 
spring is mild) as early as the month of March; 
but the tree is susceptible to cold, and if it gets 
checked it will flower as late as June, in; which 
case a failure of the crop may be anticipated. 
Old trees usually yield a crop only every alter- 
nate year, which is gathered in the autumn and 
early winter. The largest trees are found in 
Sicily, where they grow almost like oaks, and 
may be found measuring 25 ft. round the trunk. 
“The Italian Blue-book on agriculture, pu- 
blished in 1874, names 300 varieties of the tree 
as existing in Italy, of which 67 are found in 
the district of Naples. Obviously, in a country 
like Italy, where so many dialects are spoken, in 
many cases ihe names of these varieties are pure- 
ly local, and as the .same variety is called by one 
name in Tuscany and by another at Naples, it 
would be absolutely useless to mention distinct- 
ions which have no difference in a report written 
for British readers. 
“Olives are, in fact, divided into three classes, 
namely (I). the small olive with few leaves, which 
grows freely, resists the cold better than the others, 
is more free from disease, grows on the poorest 
soil, and though generally very hardy, does not 
yield good oil and is useless for table purposes. 
This tree will yield oil good enough for sharpening 
shears and for mechanical purposes generally, 
and it will grow almost anywhere. It is known 
by the names of ‘Miguda,’ ‘Trilo,’ ‘Cericiola,’ and 
‘Martino,’ in Italy. The second class, known as 
‘Olivi di Spagna,’has larger leaves, a large and . 
succulent fruit adapted for table use, subject to 
the necessary treatment. These trees require rich 
and good soil and no great vicissitudes of tern* 
perature ; they will not bear cold, and are subject 
to a good many diseases. It they get chilled the 
fruit falls, and such berries as remain give but 
little oil, and that of poor quality. These varie- 
ties are supposed to have come to Italy from 
Spain, and to have found a climate in Italy which - 
does not always agree with them. They might 
all the same do well in the warmer climate of 
Australia. The third class is preferanle for gene- 
ral cultivation, as it avoids both extremes, being 
hardy, and at the same time producing a good 
and useful crop. These are known in Italy by 
the names of ‘Razze,’ ‘Corniola,’ ‘Ogliarolo,’' 
‘Pigudo,’ ond‘ Monopolese.’ 
“Like the palm, the olive flourish in many 
places where it will bear no fruit. It will not 
yield in very hot places, and it will not endure 
frost or sudden transitions from cold to lieat; it 
does not mind sea air. and in many places on ' 
the Mediterranean it grows to the water’s edge, 
where it must often be affected by salt and spray. 
Tweve degrees centigrade below zero (10-4 degs. 
Fahr.) is enough to wither the leaves and to kill 
such roots as are on the surface. A late spring, 
frost is naturally more harmful than a winter one, 
Where the wild olive tree grows, it is a simple 
matter to transplant and graft it, but this will 
not occur in the colonies for many years to come. 
The olive also grows from seed, and this, in fact, 
though it is a slow process, is in the end superior 
to any other. The trees do better, live longer, 
and are much less liable to disease than those 
propagated in any other way. The seed will ger- 
minate in the second year if left to itself; hut if 
it is softened by being placed in a pap of clay and 
cow-dung and sown thus, it will germinate the 
same year. It is necessary to sow in thoroughly 
clean ground, so as to allow a free and prompt ex- 
pansion of the rootlets. The ground should be 
dug three feet deep, thoroughly cleaned and 
richly manured. This should he done in the

winter, and in the spring the surface should be 
laid out in shallow trenches, in which the seeds 
should be sown in rows about a foot apart, with a 
distance between the seeds of not less than six 
inches. The sharp end of the seeds should be 
upwards, and they should be treated with a fair 
amount of water. It is especially essential that 
the ground should be kept clean, and all weeds 
immediately removed. In the spring of the third 
year the seedlings may be moved to the nursery, 
all shoots appearing on the tiny trunks having 
been carefully removed. 
“The most usual way of propagating the olive 
is by means of an egg-shaped fungus growth, 
which: is found upon its roots, It is about the 
size and much the shape of any turkey’s egg, and 
grows ouside the bark. Not more than two of 
such fungi should be removed from a single tree, 
or damage will be done to it. Indeed, if propa- 
gation is attempted on a large scale, it is better 
to sacrifice one tree altogether than to run the 
risk of injuring a greater number. Thus a hun- 
dred or more of these fungi can be obtained from 
a single tree in the winter, besides n great number 
of slips and grafts in the. spring, when the tree 
can be felled and disposed of. The removal of 
the fungus must be done with care. The wood of 
the root round it must be carefully saw or chipped 
with a sharp axe. A chisel must then be used to 
undercut the fungus, and finally lift it out of its 
place. The wood which adheres to it can then be 
cut off with a sharp knife If the fungus has 
plenty of eyes it may cut up like a seed potato, 
but it is always advisable to make the pieces so 
large that each piece should have three or four 
‘eyes.’ If the fungus has made any roots, these 
should be carefully removed. The best time to 
take them is in the winter, before the sap begins 
to rise, and they can be kept till the spring in dry 
earth mixed with chaff, to soften it. They should 
be planted in March. 
THE PROVERBIAL WISDOM OF TAMILS, 
The latest addition to Trubner’s Oriental Ser- 
ies is a Classified Collection of Tamil Proverbs 
with translations, explanations, and index ar- 
rauged by Herman Jansen. All such collections 
of proverbs are of great use to anyone who wish- 
es to obtain information about the inner life of 
the uneducated natives of the country and about 
their sentiments on all manner of subjects, mor- 
al, religious, political, and social. It is extrem- 
ely difficult to get such information by means of 
cross-examination, as Indians conversing with 
Europeans are generally shy, reticent, and in- 
clined to say what they think will please their 
questioner. But when we read their proverbs we 
are to a large extent admitted behind the scenes, j wonderful identity 
and seem to hear what they say in familiar con | instance the large 
versatiori one with another. For a large portion 
of their conversation is actually made up of pro- 
verbs, which they employ as liberally as the im- 
mortal Sancho, in,the expression of their hopes 
and their fears, their praise and their blame, and 
their ideas of right and wrong. Tims it is that, 
:»s Mr. Jansen well remarks, “by a good know- 
ledge of Indian proverbs one is enabled, as it 
were, to feel the moral pulse of the Indian people, 
and a sound insight into the proverbial literature 
(•f India is like getting a microscope by which 
one can look deeply into the recesses of the na- 
tive heart.” This result is much facilitated by 
Mr. dnnsen’s careful classification of his collec- 
tion of Tamil proverbs according to their subject 
matter. The classification of the proverbs also 
enables us more easily to discern the resembl- 
ances and differences between Indian and Eng- 
lish proverbs. Thus Mr. Jansen points out 
that, while in England we have a large number 
of proverbs referring to the weather and the sea- 
sons. India has very few proverbs of the kind, as 
in this country the weather is monotonous and 1 seen the face of the 

' there are practically only two seasons. The com 
parison implied in the saying that a woman’s 
mind and winter wind change oft, would be un- 
inutelligible to Indian peasants, for in their ex- 
perience the direction of the wind is generally 
fixed by the tune of day and season of the year. 
The difference between the position of woman 
in the east and west is very clearly reflected in 
proverbs. Hi* seclusion of women at d their 
restriction to household aflairs is expressed by 
the Tamil proverb “What has a frog in a well to 
do with the affairs of the country?” applied to a 
woman who wants to know what is in the news- 
papers. Popular suspicion of female education 
is strongly put in the saying that it is better to 
marry a women of bad character than one who 
has learned to read. The Indian proverbs about 
women are affected by the fact that in India we 
have no girls and young ladies. We meet, in 
India with female children and wives, as the 
Indian woman passes atonce from being a child 
to being a wife. But in Europe young women 
have a fine time for their development, both phy- 
sical and intellectual, before they get married. 
In this transition period, then, there is a rich 
sphere for English proverbs, but, as there is no 
such period in India, there arc no such Indian 
proverbs.” India has accordingly no proverbs 
about flirting and court, and, as widows may sel- 
dom and never be remarried, there are of course 
no Indian proverbs about the dangerous wiles of 
widows on the look-out for husbands. The des- 
pised and oppressed Indian widow has little in 
common with the jolly buxom widow who plays 
such a lively part in western proverbs antf com- 
edies. 

you have seen the mother at the tank-side, there 
is no need to see the child at home’ is a recogni- 
tion of the law of heredity or of the influence of 
a mother’s teaching on.her children.’ All these 
proverbs are as true of English i s of Tamil mo- 
thers. In India as in England the beggar will 
do i-nything rather than work, so we are not siu*' 
prised to hear that. ‘If you tell a mendicant to 
•go and dig potatoes, he gets angry ; but if the 
potatoes are boiled and peeled and set before 
bun, be'will devour them.’ The dfficulty of get- 
ting money from a skinflint is comparred in 
England to ‘getting blood out of a stone,’ in 
Southern India to ‘stripping bark of a stone.’ 
When its bowels are dry with hunger, a horse 
will eat straw’ is the Tamil way of saying that 
‘hunger is the host sauce.’ That man must eat 
to live is characteristically expressed in Tamil by 
describing the body as a wall made of rice. The 
fact that ‘Delays are dangerous’ is illustrated by 
reference to a man who ‘looked out for an aus- 
picious day to dig a well to quench a burning 
house.’ The Tamil equivalents of Tt?s no use 
crying over spilt milk’ are ‘Will the flood that 
that lias leaped over its banks go back if you 
weep ?’ and ‘The water the hot iron has drunk, 
will not come back again.' He who forgets that 
charity begins at home is said-to be a man who 
feeds Brahmins,.while his own mother starves. 
As husbands in India often punish their wives 
by cutting of their noses, the irrevocable effects 
of yielding to violent fits of anger is illustrated 
by the impossibility of restoring a nose that has1 
once been cut off. A stupid person in England, 
does not know chalk from cheese or a duck from 
a daisy ; in India he sees no difference between 
a banyan tree and a tamarind, between ginger' 
and lime, or he does not know how many Panda- 
va princes there were and says 'They were as-, 
many as the legs of a bed—three.’. 
The last quoted proverb illustrates the inmense1 
pqpularty of the Mahabharnta among a l sorts 
and conditions of Hindus. The same may be 
said of the Ramayana. Both these epic poems 
are as familiar to the people of India as the 
Bible is to the people of England. Those who 
cannot read them in Sanskrit know them by means- 
of vernacular translations, and this knowledge 
is presupposed in a large number of proverbs. 
He is a Palli plant to the garden, and Saguni to- 
the family,’ could not have come into common 
use ns a proverb, if every Indian schoolboy had 
not known that Sanguni is the name of the 
Councillor wao ruined the Ehaurava family. The 
uselessness of making complaints to an unsympa- 
thetic hearer is expressed in the question, ‘If you 
recite the Mahabharata to a richly bejewelled 
woman, will she look at her ornaments or will she 
listen to the poem ?.’ From the Ramayana are’ 
drawn the three following proverbs. Of a stupid 
person it is said that ‘After having heard the 
the Ramayana read all night, be asked bow 
Rama was ralntedto Sita.’ A hypocrite is said to- . 
be •ascetic like Ravana.' When a .good master 
has a good servant, it will be remarked that Tf 
the King is like Rama, his servant will be like 
Hanuman,’ the monkey god, who distinguished 
himself by his faithful service to Rama. The 
ordinary monkey is not overlooked in proverbial 
philosophy. A man, warned that he may bo de- 
ceived, replies ‘Will a monkey miss « brunch it 
has jumped at even in the gloom of the rainy 
season?” Tlie connection of ideas is not quit i 
pla>n but the proverb bears' testimony to the 
wonderful agility displayed, by monkeys jumping 
from tree .tp tree, which we have often admired.

On the whole, however, when we compare the 
proverbs of different nations, we are much more 
struck by the resemblances than by the differen- 
ces. Almost every proverb is a touch of nature 
making the whole world kin. Proverbs are the 
expression of the public opinion of the majority 
of any nation, and it is wonderful how great "a 
consensus there is upon all essential questions of 
morality and prudence all the world over. Pro- 
verbs express the broad characteristics of human 
life and human relationship, which are very much 
the same in every age and country. The 
difference between the proverbs of different na- 
tions is not so much in the thought expressed as 
in the mode of expressing it. Of course the pro- 
verbs of India are distinguished by special local 
colouring. I heir illustrations are necessarily 
taken from the banyan tree, the betel nut, the 
monkey, and the flying fox, and from the man- 
ners and customs of the Indian people. But 
under this diversity of language is hidden 
of thought. Take for 
number of Tamil pro- 
verbs that refer to the character of a mother 
and her position in the house. Most of them are 
as true of English, French, or German mothers, 
as of those who speak the language in which 
the proverbs are expressed. They express 
truths of world wide application. They tell us 
that the relationship of mother and son 
is the closest of all relalations, that the who 
does not help his mother is the most worthless 
of men, that a mother will not abandon her child 
though it turns out a very devil. Maternal self- 
sacrifice is expressed by saying ‘she reared her 
child with meat, while she ^'ate bones.’ A child 
ought to know that ‘No temple is more beautiful 
than one’s mother.’ But children are often un- 
grateful and make little return of affection for all 
their mother’s kindness, so it is said that ’The. 
mother’s heart is tender, the child’s hard,' and-. 
that ‘Curds and rice will make a child forget its 
mother.’ The sad lot of motherless children is 
illustrated by saying that ‘A child that has not 
seen its mother's face and a crop that has not 

junction with SI. Eiotard, but in all proba- 
bility it has already taken place. Geogra- 
phically, the country is well known, so 
that exploration plays.no part in the work 
of any of these expeditions, which have 
been undertaken solely for the sake of poli- 
tical annexation. The leaders claim to 
have taken possession of the country in the 
name of either France or Abyssinia, and it 
is necessary to consider the value of this 
occupation. 
On the west bank of the Nile, the ques- 
tion depends on the relative value of the 
Egyptian claim based on former possession, 
and that of the French, maintained on the 
ground of present occupation. The British 
Government has repeatedly affirmed that 
the Bahr-cl-Ghazl is still Egyptian, and 
therefore in the British sphere of influence. 
The French reply that there arc no rights 
of sovereignty m Africa unless supported 
by occupation, and that the British retreat 
in 1885, and the declarations of 1889, leave 
them free to enter the country, and hold it 
if they can. 
On the east bank of the Nile the question 
largely hinges oh the treaty signed last 
May by Menelik and Mi. Bcnnell Itodd. 
The terms of that agreement are still secret. 
The only rumours not based on manifest 
guessing are some that have reached Paris 
from the Abyssinian capital, and the fact 
that they reach us throngh French sources 
renders them untrustworthy; but the secret 
is more likely to be betrayed in Addis- 
Abebathan in London. According to these 
rumours, England agreed to recognise the 
Abyssinian possession of the whole of the 
territory on the right bank of the Nile from 
just south of Khartoum to the Albert 
Nyanza, and north of a line drawn thence 
eastward along the second parallel of north 
latitude to the Juba. The whole of this 
vast area is at any rate claimed by the 
Abyssinians, and the Negus has entrusted 
the administration of the southern part to 
tho Franco-Russian association of Count 
Lcontieff. If this preposterous Abyssinian 
claim be admitted, then British East Africa 
is cut off from tho north by a belt of coun- 
try, either French or under French admi- 
nistration, extending right across Africa 
from the Red Sea to the Atlantic. The 
possession of Uganda and Khartoum will 
bo useless, and the millions of money de- 
voted to the Nile campaign and the Uganda 
railway will have been spent in vain. And 
this British failure will be all the more 
mortifying from the painful contrast be- 
tween the secrecy and swiftness of the 
French movements and the blundering 
clumsiness with which the English com- 
petitor in the race for Fashoda has entered 
tho field. In this case, alas 1 the race is to 
the swift, and Major Macdonald is squnn- 
■dering resources intended for the protection 
of British interests on the White Nile in 
fighting his own escort on the Nyanza 
shores.—Saturday Bcvicir. 

THE CULTIVATION OF 
OLIVES, ;; "'~1 
“ Ifc'is certain that tho greater part of the 
Mediterranean littoral was in ancient times, as 
it now is,-the hrm of the olive : and.of nil the

countries which claim thfe • tree as indigenous, 
Italy is that which is the chief cf the oil-produ- 
cing countries of the region. And in Italy it 
grows upon a great variety of soil, and in a fair 
variety of climate. It is found wild on the 
scorching and rocky hills near Taranto, where 
it grows from seeds which have probably been 
carried from place to place by birds, and casually 
deposited in some fissure, where sufficient soil 
has been found to nourish the young plant. 
For birds are extremely partial to olives ; indeed, 
in the Southern provinces of Italy, where the 
large migratory thrush, so heartily praised by 
Horace—on his journey to Brundusium—still 
abounds, we find the expense of gunpowder for ( 
bird-scaring a considerable item in the olive- 
growers’ accounts. The cultivated olive, too, is 
a tree which is very independent of soil, and may 
be seen growing on a rocky hillside or on the 
deep soil of the plains, and flourishing as well in 
the one situation as in the other. 
“ The small province of Lucca has given its 
name to the finest table oil in the world, and 
though the best oils of Bari in tiiis district com- 
pare favourably with it, they have not the same 
celebrity. 
Of the Sonth Italian oils those ol Bari have 
the greatest repute, and many of the trees 
are of great antiquity. The annual export 
of oil from Italy amounted in 1888 to 
63,500 tons. A very large proportion of this 
exports goes to the British Empire, and though 
no doubt the importers care little about the 
methods of the cultivation of the tree, ns compared 
with the market price at which they can purchase 
the oil wholesale, the cultivation is an important 
item to British trade, because a determined effort 
is boing made to introduce the tree, both in South 
Africa and the Australian colonies. The plants 
are being sent out in considerable numbers from 
Naples, chiefly, if not solely, by. the firm of 
Messrs. Dammann, of Portici. a suburb of Naples, 
who have also charged themselves with the 
introduction of the Karob into South Africa. 
“It is unnecessary to mention the variety of 
uses to which olive oil if- put, but it may be inter- 
esting to note that large quantities are used on 
sheep-runs in the colonies for sharpening the 
clippers at shearing time. Time alone can show 
what success the introduction of the tree will 
have in our colonies. It may be that the best 
oil will be produced ; it may also be that only 
the lower class oils, such as those grown in 
Turkey, which are only useful for making soap, 
will be manufactured, but at any rate a useful 
lubricant will be obtained and a very picturesque 
tree added to the landscape. In the meantime a 
report in English on the cultivation of the plant 
cannot fail to be of service. The wild olive or 
oleaster is a tree of small and stunted growth, 
and yields a fruit from which very little oil can 
be procured. The grafting of the oleaster was 
known in very ancient times, and is mentioned 
by St. Paul in his Epistle to the Romans who, 
however, for the reasons of his metaphor, or 
perhaps from ignorance of arboriculture, reverses 
the process and describes the oleaster as being 
grafted on the olive, whereas, of course, it is the 
cultivated tree which is grafted on the stem of 
the wild one. The oleaster can be raised from 
seeds in the ordinary way, or it can be raised 
from the fungoids which olives bear underground 
at the point where the roots separate themselves 
from the trunk. Olive trees live to a very great 
age, and their wood is very useful for cabinet- 
making, as it is hard as well as pliaple, and can 
be easily manipulated. The smaller boughs 
form an excellent fuel, for owing to the oil in 
them, they burn like a torch, and as the trunks 
of old trees are apt to become hollow, many of 
them are only fit for the -same purpose. The 
.rje is evergreen, and the leaves fall after about 

three years, being, of course, constantly replaced 
in the course of nature by younger ones. The 
olive commences to flower at the base of its 
foliage, the flowers gradually extending upwards, 
The best crops are always obtained when the 
trees flower early, and this occurs (when the 
spring is mild) as early as the month of March; 
but the. tree is susceptible to cold, and if it gets 
checked it will flower as late as June, in which 
case a failure of tho crop may be anticipated. 
Old trees usually yield a crop only every alter- 
nate year, which is gathered in the autumn and. 
early winter. The largest trees are found in 
Sicily, where they grow almost like oaks, and 
may be found measuring 25 ft. round the trunk. 
“The Italian Blue-book on agriculture, pu- 
blished in 1874, names 300 varieties of the tree 
as existing in Italy, of which 67 are found in 
the district of Naples. Obviously, in a country 
like Italy, where so many dialects are spoken, in 
many cases the names of these varieties are pure- 
ly local, and as the same variety is called by one 
name in Tuscany and by another at Naples, it 
would be absolutely useless to mention distinct- 
ions which have no difference in a report written 
for British readers. 
“Olives are, in fact, divided into three classes, 
namely (I). the small olive with few leaves, which 
grows freely, resists the cold better than the others, 
is more free from disease, grows on the poorest 
soil, and though generally very hardy, does not 
yield good oil and is useless for table purposes. 
This tree will yield oil good enough for sharpening 
shears and for mechanical purposes generally, 
and it will grow almost anywhere. It is known 
by the names of ‘Miguda,’ ‘Trilo,’ ‘Cericiola,’ and 
‘Martino,’ in Italy. The second class, known as 
‘Olivi di Spagna,’ has larger leaves, a large and 
succulent fruit adapted for table use, subject to 
the necessary treatment. These trees require rich 
and good soil and no great vicissitudes of tem- 
perature ; they will not bear cold, and are subject 
to a good many diseases. It they get chilled the 
fruit falls, and such berries as remain give but 
little oil, and that of poor quality. These varie- 
ties are supposed to have come to Italy from 
Spain, and to have found a climate in Italy which 
does not always agree with them. They might 
all the same do well in the warmer climate of 
Australia. The third class is preferanle for gene- 
ral cultivation, as it avoids both extremes, being 
hardy, and at the same time producing a good 
and useful crop. These areknown in Italy by 
the names of ‘Razze,’ ‘Corniola,’ ‘Ogliaroloj’ 
‘Pigudo,’ond‘ Monopolese.’ 
“Like the palm, the olive flourish in many 
places where it will bear no fruit. It will not 
yield in very hot places, and it will not endure 
frost or sudden transitions from cold to heat ; it 
does not mind sea air. and in many places on 
the Mediterranean it grows to the water’s edge, 
where it must often be affected by salt and spray. 
Tweve degrees centigrade below zero (10*4 degs. 
Fahr.) is enough to wither the leaves and to kill 
such roots as are on the surface. A late spring 
frost is naturally more harmful than a winter one. 
Where the wild olive tree grows, it is a simple 
matter to transplant and graft it, but this will 
not occur in the colonies for many years to come. 
The olive also grows from seed, and this, in fact, 
though it is a slow process, is in the end superior 
to any other. The trees do better, live longer, 
and are much less liable to disease than those 
propagated in any other way. The seed will ger- 
minate in the second year if left to itself, but if 
it is softened by being placed in a pap of clay and 
cow-dung and sown thus, it will germinate the 
same year. It is necessary to sow in thoroughly 
clean ground, so as to allow a free and prompt ex- 
pansion of the rootlets. The ground should be 
dug three feet deep, thoroughly cleaned and 
richly mnnuml. This should be done in the

panson implied ia the saving that a woman’s 
mmd and winter wind change oft, would be nn- 
inntelligible to Indian peasants, for in their ex- 
perience the direction of the wind is generally 
fixed by the tune of day and season of the year, 
the difference between the position of woman 
in the east and west is very clearly reflected in 
proverbs. Th» seclusion of women ai d their 
restriction to household affairs is expressed by 
the Tamil proverb “What has a frog in a well to 
do with the affairs of lire country?” applied to a 
woman who wants to know what is m the news- 
papers. Popular suspicion of female education 
is strongly put in the saying that it is better to 
marry a woman of bad character than one who 
has learned to read. The Indian proverbs nhont 
women are affected by the fact that in India' we 
have no girls and young ladies. We meet, in 
India with female children and wives, as the 
Indian woman passes atonce from being a child

winter, and in the spring the surface should be 
laid out in shallow trenches, in which the seeds 
should be sown in rows about a foot apart, with a 
distance between the seeds of not less than six 
inches. ’The sharp end of the seeds should be 
upwards, and they should be treated with a fair 
amount of water. It is especially essential that 
the ground should be kept clean, and all weeds 
immediately removed. In the spring of the third 
year the seedlings may be moved to the nursery, 
all shoots appearing on the tiny trunks having 
been carefully removed. 
“The most usual way of propagating the olive 
is by means of an egg-shaped fungus growth, 
which is found upon its roots. It is about the 
size and much the shape of any turkey’s egg, and 
grows onside the bark. Not more than two of 
-such fungi should be removed from a single tree, 
or damage will be done to it. Indeed, if propa- 
gation is attempted on a large scale, it is better 
to sacrifice one tree altogether than to run the 
risk of injuring a greater number. Thus a hun- 
dred or more of these fungi can be obtained from 
a single tree in the winter, besides a great number 
of slips and grafts in the, spring, when the tree 
can be felled and disposed of. The removal of 
the fungus must be done with care. The wood of 
the root round it must he carefully saw or chipped 
with a sharp axe. A chisel must then be used to 
undercut the fungus, and finally lift it out of its 
place. The wood which adheres to it can then be 
ent off with a sharp knife If the fungus has 
plenty _ of eyes it may cut up like a seed potato, 
but it is always advisable to make the pieces so

. I , *• . .. ■ CXXOl LO l lililj Oil   .....    
that ‘Curds and rice will make a child forget its 
mat while in England we have a large number imother.’ The sad lot of motherless children is 
ot ptoverbs referring to tho weather and the sea- | illustrated by saying that A child that has not 
.-mns. India has very few proveros of the kind, as seen its mother’s face and a crop that has not 
in tins country the weather ts monotonous and seen the face of tlie rain will not thrive ’ ‘When 

you have seen the mother at the tank-side, there 
is no need to see the citiid at home’ is a recogni- 
tion of the law of heredity or of the influence of 
a mother's teaching on.her children.’ All these 
proverbs are ns true of English i s of Tamil mo- 
thers. In India as in England the beggar will 
do anything i-ather than work, so we arc not stir- 
prised to hear that. Tf yon tell a mendicant to 
•go and dig potatoes, lie gets angry ; hut if the 
potatoes are boiled anti peeled and set before 
him, lie'will devour them.’ The dfflcnitv of get- 
ling money from a skinflint is compaircd in 
England to ‘getting blood out of a stone,’ in 
Southern India to ‘stripping bark of n stone.’ 
M hen its bowels are dry with hunger, a horse 
will eat straw’ is the Tamil way of saying that 
‘hunger is the host sauce.’ That man "must eat 
to live is characteristically, expressed in Tamil by 
describing the body as a wall made of rice. The 
fact that ‘Delays are dangerous’ is illustrated by 
reference to a man who ‘looked out for an aus- 
ticious day to dig a well to quench .a burning 
toitsc.’ The Tamil equivalents of ‘It’s no use 
crying over spilt milk’ are ‘Will the flood that 
that has leaped over its banks go back if you 
weep ?’ and ‘The water the hot iron lias drunk, 
will not come back again.’ He who forgets that 
charily begins.at home is said-to be a man who 
feeds brahmins, .while his own mother starves. 
As husbands in India often punish their wives 
by cutting of their noses, the irrevocable effects 
of yielding to violent fits of anger is illustrated 
by the impossibility of restoring a nose that has1 
once been cut off. A stupid person in England 
does not know chalk from cheese or a duck from 
a daisy; in India he sees no difference between 
a banyan tree and a tamarind, between ginger 
and lime, or ho does not know how many Banda- 
va princes there were and says ‘They "were as' 
many as the legs of a bed—three.’ 
Tiie last quoted proverb illustrates the imnenae' 
popularly of the Mahabharata among a t sorts 
and conditions of Hindus. The same may be 
said of the Ramayona. .Both these epic poems 
are as familiar to the people of India as the 
Bible is to the people of England. Those who 
cannot read them in Sanskrit know tliem by means 
of vernacular translations, and this knowledge 
is presupposed in a large number of proverbs. 
He is a Palli plant to the garden, and Saguni to- 
the family,’ could not have come into common 
use ns a proverb, if erery Indian schoolboy bad 
not known that Sanguni is the name of the 
Councillor wao ruined the Khanrava family. The 
uselessness of making complaints to an unsympa- 
thetic hearer is exprressed in the question. Tf you 
recite the Mahabharatn to a richly bejewelled 
woman, will she look at her ornaments or will she 
listen to the poem?’ From tho Ramayana are- 
drawn the three following proverbs. Of a stupid 
person it is said that ‘After having heard the 
the Ramayana read all night, he asked how 
Rnma was rnlnted to Sita.’ A hypocrite is said tu- 
be ascetic like Ravana.’ hen a good inaster 
has a good servant, it will be remarked that ‘if 
the King is like Rama, his servant will he like 
Hanuman, the monkey god. who distinguished 
himself by his faithful service to Rama. The 
ordinary monkey is not overlooked in proverbial 
philosophy. A man, warned that ho may be de- 
ceived, replies ‘Will a monkey miss a br.-nch it 
has jumped at even in the gloom of the rainy 
season?” The eonneclion of ideas is not quits 
plam but the proverb bears'testimony, to the 
wonderful agility displayed by monkeys jumping 
from tree to tree, which we Have often admired 
on the wooded heights of Matheran. There are 
many, other, proverbs based on observation nf the 
ways of animals.1 The. makers-of Tamil p-nverbs

caTdrTiJiTiailk?’ A religious teacher who leads ajj 
sinful life isr'liko*a cat putting on a rosary and < 
teaching religion.’ The ostrich with its head in 
the sand finds a parallel in the cat of a Tamil 
proverb, who put her head in a pot and thought 
that all was darkness. Sham valour is illustrat- 
ed by ‘the dog, that started the hare and then 
stopped short,’ as pupies often do. Man’s soul 
is not defiled by living in the material world. It 
is ‘like the mole erkket grazing in the mud’ and 
not defiled thereby.’ A good Indian equivalent 
for the Scotch ‘pig in a poke’ is ‘estimating the 
price of a buffalo, while it is lying in the water 
with only the top of its head visible. We shall 
end our specimens of Tamil proverbial philosophy | 
with an insect proverb:—‘Even an ant is eight 
span long, if measured by its own hand ;’ which 
reminds us of the puzzling question put by Aristo- 
phanes into the mouth of Socrates—‘How many 
of its own feet can a flea jump ?’   
THE NEW SOUTH AFRICAN LINErT 

A MAGNIFICENT SHIP. 

The arrival of the Union Company’s new mail 
steamer, the s.s. Briton, in Table Bay marks a 
new era in the development of the commercial 
and social relations between the Old Country 
and one of her prosperous daughter. A brief 
glance at the ship is a confirmation of the fact, 
that notwithstanding period is of stress and 
difficulty, the Union Company has the most pro- 
found faith in the future of South Africa. But’ 
for this profound faith they would never have 
had the courage nor the resources to put on the 
water four such ships as the Gascon, the Goorkha, 
the Gaika, and the Briton within the compara- 
tively short period of twelve months. The three 
greater G’s created a very deep impression on 
the shipping and commercial communities of 
Great Britain and South Africa, and, splendid 
though these ships are, they speedily fall into 
second rank when compared with the magnificent 
vessel which completed her maiden voyage at 
Cape Town yesterday morning. On3 of the 402 
passengers which shared the pleasures and com- 
forts of the maiden trip, had no hesitation in 
describing the Briton as “ a perfect ship,’ and 
this was a sentiment which was confirmed by a 
casual walk around the “ miniature city” soon 
after she steamed into the Lord Jetty. 
To those who are acquainted with the same 
company’s favourite ship, the No/vnu/i, it would 
be easy to describe the Briton in a single short 
sentence. The Briton is to all intents and pur- 
poses a glorified, magnified Norman, the difference 
of 2,863 in the tonnage giving the builders an 
opportunity for spreading themselves out a little 
in every direction. A few facts and figures may 
be quoted to show the great advance made by the 
Briton, on any other ship which has sailed in 
South African water. In the first place, it is 
over 2,000 tons larger than any vessel engaged 
in the South African, Indian, or Australian 
trade; and it is almost on a par the largest of the 
vessels which do the journey between England 
and New York. But notwithstanding her great 
bulk, the utmost gracefulness has been preserved 
:u every line and curve, and the greatest comfort 
lias been assured to her passengers. The Briton, 
like a’1 the new boats of the Union Line, has 
been built} bv the famous firm of Messrs. Hmiand 

DESCRIPTION OF THE SHIP. 

Wolff, of Belfast 
The following description of the Briton will be 
interesting: She is simply the most magnificent 
Royal Mail steamer in our whole mercantile 
mirine crossing the Equator, and a perfect speci- 
men of the highest class of modern naval archi- 
tecture. In the five steamers which constituted 
the company’s fleet in 1853 there was a little ship 
named the Tjritan, but her quality may be 

magined from the fact that the tonnage of that 
entire fleet was 2,327 tons. The noble Briton is 
herself 10,300 tons burthen, and a description of 
her splendid proportions may be completed by 
stating that she is 530 feet long, 60 feet broad, 
and 40 feet deep; is a twin-screw, with triple ex- 
pansion engines, the diameter of each set of 
cylinders being 33£ inches, 55 inches, and 90£ 
inches, and a GO-inch length of stroke ; her indi- 
cated horse-power is 10,000; there are 48 furna- 
ces, with 7 boilers, yet she is likely to prove 
reasonably economical with a coal consumption 
of 2,500, tons per voyage out or home. For all 
this the speed will, at its best, be 19. knots. The 
fleet of the Union Company to-day consists of 18 
vessels, 6 of them above 5,000, and 11 above 
3,000 tons. It was thought that the maximum 
was reached when the Noma/?, of 7,537, and the 
Scot, of 7,815 tons, were designed, but the 
'Briton as much surpasses them as they surpassed 
their predecessors. In a wood, she is the largest 
and finest vessel which lias ever connected Eng- 
land with southern or eastern lands, and as,when 
full, she will have 1,100 souls on board, she 
might be spoken of as a floating town and palace 
combined. Beautiful to the eye in her white hull 
shapely lines, slender masts, and yellow funnels, 
the Briton bears the fullest scrutiny between 
decks. In these days nothing must be spared in 
the fittings, equipments, and service of a great 
ocean liner, and in these matters the B»7fon will 
bear comparison with the best. It would be no 
consolation to a Briton's passenger complaining 
of lack of luxury or comfort to be reminded that 
a walk from bow to stern would mean exercise to 
the extent of a tenth of a mile. The Briton, 
however, is in truth superbly decorated and 
furnished. The library or music room is of in- 
laid mahogany, with teak and satinwood panels, 
lighted by a lofty dome, the glass covered with 
ornamental scroll-work, and illustrations in car- 
ved and other work of great poets and painters. 
Even the entrance passage is a copy from the 
choir stall of the Gothic cathedral at Ulm. The 
smoking saloons are all on the same scale of 
splendour; the first-class dining saloon scats 
172 passengers, and there is another smaller 
saloon of the same class on the deck below 
for the full complement is 280 first-class pas- 
sengers. For the 182 second, 122 third, and 
320 steerage passengers there is accommodation 
on an equally liberal scale according to degree. 
The second-class accommodation is equal to first 
upon many lines, and better for third-class pas- 
sengers we have never seen in any part of the 
world. There are 750 electric lights, and four 
huge refrigerating chambers for the preservation 
of the perishable stores. The twin screws work- 
ed by independent sets of engines reduce the 
risk of a breakdown to an almost imperceptible 
minimum. Six of the twenty boats are of steel ; 
an l the life-saving appliances are of the latest 
contrivance. Amongst the curiosities of con- 
struction, the visitors were informed that in the 
hull of the Briton there are 5,600 tons of steel, 
bound together by three-quarters of a million 
rivets ; and there is a double bottom extending 
the whole length of the ship, capable of affording 
space for 1,300 tons of water as effective and 
! economical ballast. Better than that, if the 
' cuter shell were ripped off by accident the second 
| floor would keep her afloat. The well-filled 
library shelves are in the music saloon, and con- 
tain, of course, a selection of the best and bright- 
Jest fiction, a new and old, and a very well- 
I choosen collection of those standard work with 
I which busy people arc so glad to renew acquaint- 
ance during the enforced idleness • f the days at 
sea. There is a delightful suggestion of Chip- 
pendale ie the quaint little btireux and writing- 
tables here, ami the hroud, roomy divans and 
nrmchai s upholsterel i 1 duV-toned blues, dashed 

with terra-cotta, are eminently suggestive of com- 
fort and repose. In the dpme of stained glass 
are portraits of great composers and poets, while 
the carved teak and satinwood panels of the walls 
have heads in relief of authors, artists, and 
scientists. Rubber tiles, a new and effective 
flooring, are used in the passage-ways to the 
cabins, as well as in the smoke-room, where the 
lounges and chairs are upholstered in dark-figured 
moroco leather, and a number of choice engra- 
vings are upon the walls. 

THE OFFICERS. 

The Briton is exceedingly fortunate in having 
such a splendid band of able and experienced 
officers. Captain Molony, an ideal commander, 
who was formerly on the Norman, is on the 
bridge, and he is assisted by the following r 
Chief officer, T. Woodward, R.N.R. ; second 
officer, A. Williams, R.N.R. ; fourth officer, T. 
A. Jones, R.N.R. ; fifth officer, F. Tunbridge ; 
surgeon, A, E. Norburn, M.D. ; captain’s clerk, 
S. C. J. Freeman-Matthews ; cliief engineer, W. - 
G. Fraser; steward, W. Willis; stewardess, 
Mrs. Whitlock; assistarit stewardess, Mrs.

LOCAL NEWS. 
The s. s. Safari with mails from Bom- 

bay is expected here on the 5th insf. 

The D.O.A.L. mail steamer is due to ar- 
rive on the 10th inst. bringing three weeks 
mails from Europe. 

On the arrival at Portsmouth at the end 
of January last of H. M. S. ‘St. George,’ the 
late flagship of the Cape Squadron, the Offi- 
cers and crew were entertained by the May- 
or at a banquet in the Town Hall. This 
home-coming welcome to British sailors is 
unique. The reason of it lies in the fact 
that the ‘St. George’ has seen more active 
service during her late commission than any 
other British warship of 'modern times. 
She hoisted the pennant at Portsmouth 
just over three years ago to relievo the ‘Ra- 
leigh’ on the Cope Station. Within a few 
weeks of her arrival on the West Coast it was 
found necessary to punish the natives of the 
Brass district in the Niger Protectorate. 
The expedition was composed of the ‘St. 
George' 'Whhjen' and 'Thrush’. Six months 
later sho was engaged against Mweli in the 
same district. Then came the demonstra- 
tion at Delagoa-Bay which happily had no 
disastrous results. ■ 
The next war service the ‘St. George’ was 
engaged in was the bombardment of Zanzi- 
bar, the details of which we all know. Fi- 
nally the most serious of all the‘St. George's' 
expeditions, was that against the King of 
Benin just a year ago. This resulted in the 
city of Benin being captured after eight 
hours fighting. ' ' 

A con-espondent has kindly furnished us 
with the following full account of the re- 
cent Lawn Tennis Tournament:— 
The first.match in the Tournament took 
place on Friday the 4th of February when 
Messrs. MacLennan and Nicol played 
Messrs. Cave and Denne, with the result 
that the latter won easily in the 3rd and 
winning set, when the score stood 6.2, 3.6, 
6B. A week later Messrs. Steele and' 
Wright met Messrs. Caine and Croall and 
defeated them, though the first set was a 
very even one. Score 6.5 6.3. The first 
round was concluded on the 14th ultimo 
when Messrs. Blagden and Whyte won 
their match against Messrs. Cornish and 
Musters, after a well contested three sets 
m which the two latter players lost the first 
set by three games, won the second by 1 
game and lost the last by 1 game (score 6.3, 
o.o, o.5.) 
The second round was started on the 18th 
ultimo by the match between Messrs. 
Blagden and Whyte, and Steele and Wright, 
which the former couple won, the games 
bemg 6.5, 6 4, and afterwards, upon the 
-ilst ultimo Messrs. Cave and Denne met 
and easily defeated Messrs. Baglehole and 
■Keilly, who were not playing up to their 
accustomed form. 
Finally last Saturday Messrs. Whyte and 
Blagden played Messrs. Cave and Denne, 
and this match was watched with the great- 
est keenness by the by no means small 
gathering of onlookers in the Pavilion, and 
proved, as was (at a ly rate by some of us), 

THE GAZETTE 

anticipated, a really good contest. Messrs. 
Whyte and Blagden won the first set 6 
games to 4, and Messrs. Cave and Denne 
the second 6 games to 5. In the 3rd and 
winning set, which was very close, 5 games 
all having been scored, it was decided that 
deuce and vantage games should he played 
which compelled either side to wiu 2 games 
m succession in order to win the match, 
and this Messrs. Blagdeu and Whyte 
succeeded in doing, thus securing the Prize. 

his Lordship Bishop Allgeyer who left 
Zanzibar on the 12th January for a Pastoral 
visit to his Missions on the Mainland left
